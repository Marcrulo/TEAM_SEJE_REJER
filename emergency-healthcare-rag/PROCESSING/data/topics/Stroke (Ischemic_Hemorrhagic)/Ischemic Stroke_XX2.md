## Treatment / Management

The goal of therapy in acute ischemic stroke is to preserve tissue in areas where perfusion is decreased but sufficient to avoid infarction. Tissue in this area of oligemia is preserved by restoring blood flow to the compromised regions and improving collateral flow. Recanalization strategies include IV recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and mechanical thrombectomy. Restoring blood flow can minimize the effects of ischemia only if performed quickly. The use of endovascular techniques has been used successfully in selected patients to treat acute ischemic stroke. Another consideration is neuroprotective agents, but none have been shown to improve clinical outcomes.

Essential treatments that have been shown in controlled trials to be efficacious in acute ischemic stroke treatment in different patient groups include the following:

**Acute Reperfusion Therapy**

  * **IV alteplase (within 4.5 hours of stroke onset):** The American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) recommends IV alteplase (TPA) for patients who satisfy inclusion criteria and have symptom onset or last known baseline within 3 hours.[40] IV TPA should be administered at 0.9 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 90 mg. The first 10% of the dose is given as a bolus over the first minute, and the remainder is given over the next 60 minutes. The time has been extended to 4.5 hours for selected candidates. 

Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of ischemic stroke with "measurable neurological deficit," symptom onset within 3 hours before treatment, and age 18 or older.[40]

Healthcare providers should review the exclusion criteria for thrombolytics before administering TPA. According to the FDA, the contraindications to IV thrombolysis include active internal bleeding, recent intracranial surgery or severe head trauma, intracranial conditions that may increase the risk of bleeding, bleeding diathesis, severe uncontrolled hypertension, current intracranial hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a history of a recent stroke.

Healthcare providers must consider the treatment benefits and risks for patients who present between **3 hours and 4.5 hours** from symptom onset. Additional relative exclusion criteria for this patient category include age older than 80 years, NIHSS >25, oral anticoagulant use, and a history of diabetes and prior ischemic stroke.[40]

  * **MRI-guided thrombolysis for stroke with unknown time of onset:** Most of these patients wake up with an acute stroke. The patients will be ineligible for IV thrombolytic therapy because their last known normal will be at bedtime. The WAKE-UP Stroke Trial used the mismatch between a positive DWI MRI sequence showing an acute ischemic infarction and a negative FLAIR MRI sequence indicating that the infarct occurs within 4.5 hours of the MRI. DWI is positive within 30 minutes of an acute infarct. FLAIR sequence will not be positive until about 4.5 hours after an acute infarct. The mismatch indicates that the stroke occurred within 4.5 hours, and therefore, IV thrombolytic will be indicated. The WAKE-UP Stroke Trial confirmed the positive result.[36][41]

  * **IV tenecteplase (within 4.5 hours of stroke onset):** Another fibrinolytic agent, tenecteplase (TNK), may be considered an alternative to alteplase. TNK has advantages over TPA with its longer half-life and can be administered as a single Intravascular (IV) dose. TNK can be given at a dose of 30 to 50 mg IV bolus over 5 sec once (based on weight). TNK has become the fibrinolytic agent of choice for many stroke centers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that TNK appeared to have efficacy and safety profiles similar to TPA.[42][43] The 2023 AHA guidelines state that choosing TNK over TPA in patients without contraindications for IV fibrinolytic who are also eligible to undergo mechanical thrombectomy may be reasonable.[34] A dose of 0.4 mg/kg, compared to 0.25 mg/kg, showed no advantage.

  * **Mechanical thrombectomy (within 6 hours of stroke onset):** Mechanical thrombectomy should be considered in all patients, even those who received fibrinolytic therapy. The AHA/ASA guidelines do not recommend observation for a response after IV TPA in patients considered for mechanical thrombectomy.[40]

In recent years, significant advancements have been made in acute stroke care. Multiple stroke trials in 2015 showed that endovascular thrombectomy in the first 6 hours is much better than standard medical care in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. These benefits are sustained irrespective of geographical location and patient characteristics.[44] Please see StatPearls' companion resource, "[Acute Stroke](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17174)," for more information.

  * **Mechanical thrombectomy with perfusion study (within 16 to 24 hours of stroke onset):** Perfusion imaging studies (CT perfusion or MR perfusion) can define the areas of the brain that are ischemic but not infarcted, the ischemic penumbra. Depending on the size of the penumbra relative to the ischemic core, good amounts of brain tissue can be salvaged by restoring blood flow in cases of LVO identified on CT or MR angiogram, resulting in better clinical outcomes. 

In 2018, a significant paradigm shift occurred in stroke care. The DAWN trial showed significant benefits of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with LVO in the arteries of the proximal anterior circulation. This trial extended the stroke window to 24 hours in selected patients using perfusion imaging. Subsequently, more patients can be treated, even up to 24 hours.[45]

Mechanical thrombectomy is recommended within 6 to 16 hours of the last known normal in selected patients with LVO with acute ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation and meets other DAWN and DEFUSE 3 criteria. In selected patients who meet the DAWN criteria, mechanical thrombectomy is reasonable within 24 hours of the last known normal.[45][46]

  * **Endovascular therapy (thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke with large infarct:** Two large trials published in 2023, the ANGEL ASPECT Trial and the SELECT 2 Trial, showed positive results with endovascular thrombectomy therapy for patients with large ischemic strokes due to LVO and an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) of 3 to 5. The patients presented within 24 hours of the last known normal. Their NIHSS score is >6\. The outcomes are better among patients treated with thrombectomy than those on standard medical therapy.[47][48]****

**Definition of LVO:** Intracranial internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery (M1), basilar artery, and posterior cerebral artery (P1) occlusion [49]

**Determining ASPECTS:** This is a 10-point score system for acute middle cerebral artery territory ischemic stroke. One point will be deducted from 10 with an area of the brain infarcted, as shown on CT. Therefore, the smaller the number, the larger the infarct size. These regions are the caudate, putamen, internal capsule, insular cortex, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M6.[50]

**Basilar artery occlusion:** This particular type of rare stroke, with about 80% of patients ending up with poor outcomes. AHA guidelines recommend mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours of onset. Two large trials published in 2022 demonstrate the benefits of endovascular treatment over conventional therapy. The ATTENTION trial showed the benefits within 12 hours.[51] The BAOCHE trial showed the benefits of thrombectomy 6 to 24 hours after strokes due to basilar artery occlusion.[52] In conclusion, thrombectomy should be considered in the treatment of these patients for up to 24 hours.

**Acute Hospital Management** [34]

  * **Blood pressure:** The guidelines suggest blood pressure (BP) management of <180/105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after IV TPA. The 2023 AHA guidelines also recommended that in patients for whom mechanical thrombectomy is planned and who have not received IV fibrinolytic therapy, it is reasonable to maintain BP ≤185/110 mm Hg before the procedure.[40] A new recommendation is lowering BP initially by 15% in patients with comorbid conditions such as acute heart failure or aortic dissection. Antihypertensive management does not prevent death or dependency in patients with BP <220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV TPA and have no comorbid conditions requiring blood pressure reduction. The theoretical risk of BP lowering is the potential reduction of perfusion to the ischemic areas, which is pressure-dependent. The risk applies to the first 48 to 72 hours after an acute ischemic stroke. For patients with a BP ≥220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV TPA, the guideline suggests it may be reasonable to reduce BP by 15% in the first 24 hours, although the benefit is uncertain. A large trial recently published showed a U-shaped curve correlating acute MAP and stroke clinical outcomes. The ideal mean systolic BP is 135 mm Hg to 150 mm Hg.[40]

Antihypertensive options include the following:

    * Labetalol 10 to 20 mg IV; may repeat once

    * Nicardipine 5 mg/hour IV. Increase 2.5 mg/hour every 5 to 15 minutes. The maximum dose is 15 mg/hour.

    * Clevidipine 1 to 2 mg/hour IV. Double dose every 15 minutes. Maximum 21 mg/hour.

    * Hydralazine and enalaprilat may be considered.

Hypotension and hypovolemia should be avoided because cerebral perfusion pressure is dependent on the maintenance of an elevated MAP as ICP increases due to an ischemic event (see **Image.** Cushing Reaction: CNS Ischemic Response).

  * **Temperature:** Hyperthermia >38 °C should be avoided and treated appropriately. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen may be used. Common sources of infection, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, should be ruled out. There is insufficient data to support therapeutic hypothermia in acute ischemic strokes currently. A retrospective study recently demonstrated an association between a peak temperature >39 °C (100.4 °F) in the first 24 hours and an increased risk of in-hospital mortality.

  * **Glucose:** Maintain glucose in the 140 to 180 mg/dL range in the first 24 hours. Healthcare providers should treat blood glucose <60 mg/dL to achieve normoglycemia. The brain is dependent on oxidative pathways that require glucose for metabolism, and the metabolic demand of the brain is high; therefore, hypoglycemic episodes can decrease the brain's ability to repair. However, hyperglycemia is hypothesized to decrease reperfusion due to the oxidation of nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms and subsequent loss of vascular tone. Moreover, increased acidosis also plays a part, possibly due to injury to lactic acid-sensing channels. Capes et al showed that hyperglycemia in ischemic stroke patients increases 30-day mortality and is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke conversion.[53]

  * **Nutrition:** Early enteric feeding should be encouraged. For patients with dysphagia, use a nasogastric tube to promote enteric feeding. If there is concern that the patient may have swallowing difficulties for a prolonged period (more than 2 to 3 weeks), placing a percutaneous gastrostomy tube is recommended. Early feeding has been demonstrated to have an absolute reduction in the risk of death.[54]

  * **DVT prophylaxis:** Intermittent pneumatic compression is recommended for all immobile patients unless contraindications exist. The European Stroke Organization recommended acutely intermittent pneumatic compression for all immobile stroke patients. They also recommended low-dose heparin or low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis if the benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding.[55][56]

  * **Depression screening:** Screening for depression should be considered after an acute ischemic stroke. Rates of post-stroke depression range from 18% to 33%. Risk factors are female sex, large strokes, a stroke affecting the frontal areas, and poor social support. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the best medications for post-stroke depression.[57][58]

  * **Cerebellar/Cerebral edema:** Cerebral edema occurs with acute ischemic stroke, first due to cytotoxic edema with cell swelling, followed by vasogenic edema when the blood-brain barrier is lost. The degree and volume of cerebral edema correlate well with the size of the stroke. Cerebral edema is not significant clinically in lacunar infarction. However, cerebral edema may become symptomatic, resulting in worsening of the stroke symptoms and worse in impairment of consciousness due to herniation. Cerebral edema peaks in 3 to 5 days after an ischemic stroke.[59]

Cerebellar edema complicates cerebellar infarctions, and clinicians must know that these patients can rapidly decompensate. The increased ICP can cause obstructing hydrocephalus on the fourth ventricle or cause transtentorial herniation of the superior vermis and downward cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Signs include change or worsening mental status, decreased level of consciousness, respiratory abnormalities, change in pupillary size, posturing, and death.

Early recognition and diagnosis of intracranial hypertension due to cerebral edema are essential in caring for acute stroke patients to improve outcomes. Obtain neurosurgical consultation early. A ventriculostomy is indicated in the setting of obstructive hydrocephalus after cerebellar infarct. A decompressive suboccipital craniectomy is highly recommended in cerebellar edema with mass effect cases.[60][61]

  * **Seizures:** Post-stroke seizures occur in about 10% of patients, mainly hemorrhagic strokes or cortical infarcts. If the patient experiences a seizure within the first 2 weeks, antiepileptic drugs are indicated for a short period, generally 1 month. Long-term anticonvulsant therapy will be indicated if the seizure occurs later, for weeks or months after a stroke. However, the routine prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs is not recommended as per the newer AHA guidelines on the management of Hemorrhagic stroke as well as the ENLS guidelines.[62][63]

  * **Cardiac evaluation:** Cardiac monitoring for atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias is recommended in the first 24 hours. The benefit of further monitoring after that is unclear. An initial troponin is recommended because there is an association between stroke and coronary artery disease.

  * **Antiplatelet treatment:** Aspirin is recommended within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset. A Cochrane review concluded that aspirin given within 48 hours of symptom onset for ischemic strokes prevented the recurrence of ischemic strokes and improved long-term outcomes. In addition, there was no significant risk of early intracranial hemorrhage with aspirin.[64]

  * **Antithrombotic treatment:** Full-dose anticoagulation is not recommended in acute stroke. The main exception is low-dose anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis. 

In patients with atrial fibrillation, the guidelines state it is reasonable to initiate oral anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after neurological symptoms onset. When to start anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation after acute stroke is always a dilemma; initiation usually depends on factors like stroke size and other comorbidities. Usually, if the stroke size is small to moderate, anticoagulation is started in 7 to 14 days.[65]

Sometimes, there are patients with small hemorrhagic transformation after acute stroke, and in this scenario, delay of anticoagulation is warranted. Delay of anticoagulation after hemorrhagic transformation is not associated with excessive stroke recurrence.[66]

  * **Statins:** High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin 20 mg daily) are recommended for patients younger than 75 years with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition, patients may be continued on statins if they were on them before the ischemic stroke.[67]

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke includes the following:

  * Complicated migraine

  * Drug toxicity 

  * Intracranial abscess

  * Intracranial hemorrhage

  * Intracranial tumor

  * Hyperglycemia

  * Hypoglycemia

  * Hypertensive encephalopathy

  * Metabolic abnormalities

  * Movement disorders

  * Multiple sclerosis

  * Seizure

  * Sepsis

  * Syncope

  * Wernicke encephalopathy

## Prognosis

Prognosis in stroke is pivotal in guiding treatment decisions and informing patients and caregivers about potential outcomes. The prognosis involves assessing various factors such as the type of stroke, its severity, the extent of neurological deficits, comorbidities, and response to treatment. Predictive tools, including clinical scales and imaging modalities, aid in predicting outcomes like functional impairment, mortality, and risk of recurrence (see **Image.** Encephalomalacia Following Ischemic Stroke). Early intervention and rehabilitation significantly influence prognosis, highlighting the importance of prompt medical attention and personalized care. While some individuals may achieve full recovery, others might experience long-term disabilities or complications. The prognosis in stroke emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary approaches, ongoing monitoring, and support to optimize outcomes and enhance the quality of life for affected individuals and their families.[68][69]

## Complications

The complications of acute ischemic stroke are many and common.[70] These include but are not limited to the following:

  * DVT and pulmonary embolism: DVT prophylaxis is indicated. 

  * Aspiration and pneumonia: A swallowing evaluation before feeding is always indicated and is part of stroke center accreditation.

  * Seizures 

  * Depression 

  * Cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure

## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Early rehabilitation for stroke patients is beneficial, although very early rehabilitation, within 24 hours, should be avoided. The AVERT trial randomized patients to receive very early rehabilitation within 24 hours of stroke compared to usual stroke-unit care, and early mobilization demonstrated less favorable outcomes using the modified Rankin score.[71]

## Deterrence and Patient Education

Deterrence and prevention strategies play a vital role in reducing the incidence and impact of ischemic stroke. By addressing modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, and smoking through lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, individuals can significantly decrease their likelihood of experiencing a stroke. Additionally, raising awareness about the warning signs of stroke and promoting timely access to medical care for symptoms such as sudden weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking can expedite treatment and minimize damage. Community-based education campaigns emphasizing healthy behaviors, regular exercise, and balanced diets further contribute to stroke prevention efforts. Through comprehensive efforts targeting both individual behaviors and societal factors, it is possible to mitigate the burden of ischemic stroke and enhance overall public health.

## Pearls and Other Issues

Clinical pearls that offer valuable insights into the management and care of patients with ischemic stroke include the following:

  * Have a low threshold for evaluation of stroke, especially in at-risk populations. TIME IS BRAIN! 

  * Stroke symptoms depend on the ischemic area of the brain and, therefore, vary. 

  * Noncontrast head CT is the first imaging indicated for acute stroke, mainly to rule out hemorrhage. 

  * Consider TPA or TNK if thrombotic CVA is identified within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. 

  * When indicated, an early CT angiogram or MR angiogram with perfusion study should be obtained to look for LVO and initiate endovascular thrombectomy therapy within 6 to 24 hours. 

  * Be aware of presenting blood pressure. Blood pressure management recommendations may include aggressive blood pressure management or permissive hypertension, depending on the type of stroke and whether IV fibrinolytic is indicated. 

  * Start an antiplatelet agent within 24 hours of presentation. 

  * Consider other risk factor management, including addressing hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and cardiac arrhythmias that may increase the risk of vascular disease or a thrombotic event. 

  * Consider early and aggressive physical and occupational therapy after the onset of CVA.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

The effective management of ischemic stroke demands a cohesive and interprofessional healthcare team dedicated to delivering patient-centered care, improving outcomes, and maximizing safety and team performance. This approach includes physicians, advanced care practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, neuroimaging technicians, rehabilitation therapists, and stroke specialists working together.

Prompt recognition and treatment of ischemic stroke is critical. Emergency medicine providers must be adept at identifying early stroke symptoms to initiate immediate care. Neuroimaging technicians and radiologists are essential for quickly obtaining and interpreting scans such as CTs and MRIs, which are vital for confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Neurointeventionalists may be needed to provide interventions such as thrombectomies. Pharmacists play a crucial role in ensuring the timely administration of thrombolytic agents when appropriate and in managing the patient's medication regimen to prevent complications and secondary strokes. Nurses monitor patients closely for changes in condition and manage care protocols. Rehabilitation therapists are vital to the patient's recovery process, starting in the acute phase and continuing through long-term rehabilitation.

The prognosis for patients treated with TPA is good, but the outcomes are guarded for those who do not receive thrombolytic medication.[72] Effective communication among all team members is paramount for the rapid diagnosis, decision-making, and implementation of treatment plans. This collaboration facilitates a comprehensive approach to care, from acute management to rehabilitation and secondary prevention. All care decisions should be based on ethical considerations, including informed consent and respect for patient autonomy. The team prioritizes shared decision-making, respecting patient preferences while ensuring beneficence and non-maleficence.

An interprofessional healthcare team approach is essential for a timely and effective response, minimizing complications, and prioritizing patient safety and quality of care in managing ischemic stroke. Education and ongoing professional development are essential. They ensure the healthcare team remains knowledgeable about the latest evidence-based practices in stroke care, from acute management to prevention of recurrence. Through dedicated collaboration, the healthcare team will provide patient-centered care from emergency care to rehabilitation, ultimately enhancing outcomes and quality of life for affected patients.
