## Differential Diagnosis

Since PE has a very heterogeneous clinical presentation ranging from dyspnea to sudden cardiac arrest.[85] The differential diagnosis of PE is extensive and includes:

  * Acute coronary syndrome

  * Stable angina

  * Acute pericarditis

  * Congestive heart failure

  * Malignancy

  * Cardiac arrhythmias

  * Pneumonia

  * Pneumonitis

  * Pneumothorax

  * Vasovagal syncope

## Prognosis

Shock and right ventricular dysfunction confer a poor prognosis and predict mortality in patients diagnosed with PE.[63] Patients with PE and a coexisting DVT are also at an increased risk for death. While earlier reports reported a high rate of mortality following pulmonary infarction, a study from 2018 found the survival to discharge rate of those suffering from a pulmonary infarction to be high at around 97%.[86]

Several prognostic models have been designed, but the PE Severity Index (PESI) and the simplified PESI (sPESI) are the most commonly used. The PESI score predicts 30-day mortality in patients with an established diagnosis of PE.[87] The principal strength of the PESI and sPESI is identifying patients at low risk for 30-day mortality (PESI classes I and II).

**Original and Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index**

The following parameters are utilized in each version of the PESI (original version [87]/simplified version [88]):

  * Age: 1 point (if age older than 80 years)

  * Male sex: +10 points/–

  * Cancer: +30 points/1 point

  * Chronic heart failure: +10 points/1 point

  * Chronic pulmonary disease: +10 points/1 point

  * Pulse rate ≥110 bpm: +20 points/1 point

  * Systolic BP <100 mm Hg: +30 points/1 point

  * Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min: +20 points/–

  * Temperature <36 °C: +20 points/–

  * Altered mental status: +60 points/–

  * Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation <90%: +20 points/1 point 

Risk Stratification in PESI includes the following classes:

  * Class I: Points ≤65; low 30-day mortality risk from 1% to 6%.

  * Class II: Points 66 to 85; low mortality risk from 1.7% to 3.5%

  * Class III: Points 86 to 105; moderate mortality risk from 3.2% to 7.1%

  * Class IV: Points 106 to 125; high mortality risk from 4% to 11.4%

  * Class V: Points >125; high mortality risk from 10% to 24.5%

Risk Stratification in sPESI includes the following classes:

  * If 0 points: 1.0% 30-day mortality risk 

  * If ≥1 points: 10.9% 30-day mortality risk 

## Complications

The primary complications associated with PE include:

  * Recurrent thromboembolism

  * Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension

  * Right heart failure

  * Cardiogenic shock

PE, if left untreated, is associated with mortality of up to 30%. Studies have also suggested an increased risk of stroke, thought to be due to paradoxical embolism via a patent foramen ovale in patients with acute PE.[89]

**Recurrent Thromboembolism**

In the 1 to 2 weeks following diagnosis, patients may deteriorate and experience recurrence. Inadequate anticoagulation is the most common reason for recurrent venous thromboembolism while on therapy. 

**Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension**

The development of persistent or progressive dyspnea, particularly during the first 3 months to 2 years after diagnosis, should prompt the clinician to investigate the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which affects up to 5% of patients. In patients who remain persistently symptomatic months to years after an acute PE, follow-up CT, ventilation-perfusion scans, or echocardiography should be performed. These modalities demonstrate pulmonary hypertension in CTEPH.

On the V/Q scan, patients with CTEPH generally have at least 1 segmental or more significant mismatched ventilation-perfusion defect. For those patients with evidence of CTEPH on V/Q lung scanning, right heart catheterization, and pulmonary angiography are indicated to confirm pulmonary hypertension, quantify the degree of pulmonary hypertension, exclude competing diagnoses, define the surgical accessibility of the obstructing thrombotic lesions, and confirm that an acceptable component of the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due to surgically accessible disease and not from distal obstruction or a secondary arteriopathy, for all patients with CTEPH, lifelong anticoagulant therapy is recommended. Also, early referral for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is highly recommended.

## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Individuals who have survived PEs often demonstrate decreases in multiple functional deficits, including respiratory volume, exercise tolerance, and reported quality of life. Approximately half of the survivors have persistent symptoms reducing their physical capacity. Continuing studies are needed to identify risk factors for individuals more likely to experience significant deficits following PE resolution.

The results of various studies have demonstrated different parameters for rehabilitation following PE and various program initiation times, ranging from weeks to months following diagnosis. These studies demonstrate minimal risks, with outcomes including a significant reduction in dyspnea and improvement in exercise capacity, functional mobility, and quality of life.[90][91] Rehabilitation services should work closely with the other care team members to identify deficits and develop a tailored care plan to address these deficits within safe parameters for each patient.

## Pearls and Other Issues

A timely diagnosis of PE is crucial because of the high associated mortality and morbidity, which may be prevented with early treatment. Patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of VTE and PE since the incidence of recurrent thromboembolism is high. Notably, 30% of untreated patients with PEs die, while only 8% die after timely therapy.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

Effective management of acute PE requires seamless interprofessional collaboration to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure patient safety. Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have emerged as an innovative approach to addressing the complexities of PE treatment. Composed of specialists in pulmonary medicine, critical care, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery, PERTs facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention, ensuring that patients benefit from the collective expertise of diverse disciplines. Studies demonstrate that PERTs improve communication, streamline treatment efforts, and lead to more coordinated and effective care.

In the larger framework of an interprofessional team, nurses, pharmacists, and advanced practitioners play pivotal roles alongside physicians. As frontline clinicians, nurses contribute critical observations and ensure the timely implementation of prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Pharmacists, as experts in anticoagulation therapy, provide essential input on drug selection, contraindications, and potential interactions, ensuring the safety and efficacy of treatment. Open communication and mutual respect among all healthcare professionals allow for comprehensive and well-informed decision-making, empowering each team member to contribute actively to patient care.

By fostering a collaborative environment, PERTs and interprofessional teams optimize care coordination and team performance. This approach emphasizes shared responsibilities, effective communication, and a unified strategy, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and improved safety in managing acute PE. Integrating diverse expertise within a cohesive team ensures patients receive timely, evidence-based, patient-centered care.
