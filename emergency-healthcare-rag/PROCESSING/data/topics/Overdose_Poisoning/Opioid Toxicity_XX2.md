## History and Physical

**History**

Most patients who overdose on opiates are lethargic or comatose. Thus, the history is typically gathered from family, friends, bystanders, or emergency medical service providers. Pills, empty bottles, needles, syringes, and other drug paraphernalia are often found at the scene. Important details to obtain in the history include the amount of drug ingested, congestion, and time of ingestion. In some cases, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel may administer naloxone in the prehospital setting, which can help confirm the diagnosis of opiate overdose.[20][21][22][23]

**Physical Examination**

Patients with opiate overdose commonly exhibit lethargy or a depressed level of consciousness. Opiate overdose also leads to respiratory depression, generalized central nervous system (CNS) impairment, and miosis. However, healthcare workers must recognize that miosis is not always present in every patient with opiate overdose, and other causes of CNS and respiratory depression should be considered. Additional signs of opiate overdose include euphoria, drowsiness, altered mental status, fresh needle marks, seizures, and conjunctival injection.

**Skin evaluation**

Examination of the extremities may reveal needle track marks in individuals who abuse intravenous opiates. Many people with substance use disorders also inject morphine and heroin subcutaneously. In some cases, opium oil may be inhaled, and individuals may have patch marks on their bodies from fentanyl use. Most opiates can trigger the release of histamine, leading to itching, skin flushing, and urticaria.

**Pulmonary assessment**

In some morphine toxicity cases, respiratory distress and hypoxia may present with pupillary dilation. Additionally, drugs such as meperidine, morphine, propoxyphene, and diphenoxylate/atropine can cause midpoint pupils or frank mydriasis. Breathing is typically impaired in patients with morphine overdose. One may observe shallow breathing, hypopnea, and bradypnea, with a respiratory rate of 4 to 6 breaths per minute. Since opiates may also cause bronchoconstriction, some individuals may present with dyspnea, wheezing, and frothy sputum production.

**Cardiovascular examination**

Most opiates cause peripheral vasodilation, which can lead to moderate-to-severe hypotension. However, this hypotension may be reversed with changes in body position or fluid administration. Other coingestants must be considered if the hypotension is severe and unresponsive to fluids.

**Gastrointestinal evaluation**

Nausea and vomiting are common in patients with opiate toxicity. These symptoms occur because opiates can induce gastric aperistalsis and slow down intestinal motility.

**Psychiatric features**

Opiates are generalized CNS depressants. However, these drugs can also cause anxiety, agitation, depression, dysphoria, hallucinations, nightmares, and paranoia.

**Neurological assessment**

Opiates can lower the seizure threshold, potentially leading to generalized seizures, particularly in young children. This effect is mainly due to the paradoxical excitation of the brain. The opiates most commonly involved in adults experiencing seizures are propoxyphene and meperidine. Hearing loss may occur in rare cases, particularly in individuals who have consumed alcohol with heroin. However, this auditory deficit is usually reversible.

## Evaluation

Opiate overdose or toxicity must always be considered in patients presenting with lethargy of an unknown cause. Many individuals who abuse opiates may concurrently use other illicit substances, such as cocaine, or prescription drugs, like antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Suspicion of coingestants should be raised when the usual clinical signs and symptoms of opiate toxicity are absent and the patient does not respond to the opiate antagonist naloxone.[24][25][26][27]

**Laboratory Studies**

Laboratory studies are often conducted for patients with drug overdoses. Drug screens are widely available but may not significantly affect initial management due to the high potential for false positives and negatives. In patients with opiate toxicity or overdose, the following blood work is usually performed:

  * Complete blood cell count

  * Comprehensive metabolic panel

  * Creatine kinase level

  * Arterial blood gas determinations

  * Pregnancy testing

  * Acetaminophen and salicylate testing

**Imaging Studies**

A chest x-ray should be obtained if lung injury is suspected. An abdominal x-ray or computed tomography should be obtained if the patient is possibly a body packer. 

**Electrocardiography**

Electrocardiography (ECG) is recommended in all patients with suspected opioid overdose. Coingestants like tricyclics have the potential to cause arrhythmias.

## Treatment / Management

**Prehospital Management**

Often, the first responder at the scene of a suspected opioid overdose is a nonmedical individual, such as a police officer. As of 2016, over 1,214 law enforcement agencies have trained their officers to administer naloxone in the field. This community involvement has led to increased survival rates following overdose incidents in the Midwest United States.[28]

Emergency medical technicians must be aware of prearrival naloxone administration by law enforcement and its effects. In some cases, patients may experience a complete reversal of toxicity and refuse further medical care or transportation to an emergency department. Studies have shown low short-term mortality rates in these cases. However, the potential risks of recurrent toxicity must be explained to these individuals, as well as the associated morbidity and mortality.[29][30]

If EMS are the first responders, priority should be given to assessing airway and hemodynamic stability. Naloxone should be administered in cases of decreased respirations. If the individual has no intravenous access, naloxone may be given intramuscularly, intranasally, intraosseously, or endotracheally via an endotracheal tube.

Data show that the intranasal route is as effective as the intramuscular route in the prehospital setting. However, naloxone may cause agitation and aggression when it reverses the opioid effects. The lowest naloxone dose necessary to reverse respiratory apnea should be administered in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Patients may become combative or violent in the ambulance, and restraints may be needed for the safety of both the patient and EMS personnel. If the patient remains unresponsive to naloxone, endotracheal intubation should be considered to protect the airway.

**Emergency Department Care**

Immediate assessment of the patient's airway and hemodynamics should be given priority upon evaluation in the emergency department. Additional information from EMS personnel should include the presence of any drugs or paraphernalia, the patient's initial presentation (including vital signs), any potential trauma, and details regarding the timing and specifics of the suspected overdose. EMS personnel at the scene may have already secured the airway by administering naloxone or performing endotracheal intubation in some cases. Emergency physicians should evaluate the patient's airway and breathing upon arrival and determine if further intervention is necessary.

Immobilization should be prioritized if suspicion of occult trauma to the cervical spine arises. A capillary blood glucose level should be checked in any patient presenting with an unknown cause of lethargy or loss of consciousness, even if an overdose is highly suspected.

Initial treatment of overdose starts with supportive care, including assistance with respiration, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the absence of spontaneous circulation, and removal of any opioid agent, such as a patch or infusion. Naloxone should be administered immediately when an opioid overdose is suspected as the cause of respiratory and CNS depression, without delay for laboratory studies.

**Naloxone administration**

Naloxone is a pure competitive antagonist of opiate receptors and has no agonistic activity. The drug is relatively safe and may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or endotracheally, though research on tracheal absorption has been conducted only in animal models. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an intranasal formulation commonly used by first responders in patients without intravenous access. Intranasal naloxone is also available to the community.[31]

After naloxone administration, the onset of action occurs within minutes, regardless of the route. A second dose may be given every 2 to 3 minutes. With subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the onset may be delayed by 3 to 10 minutes. The goal of naloxone administration is to restore adequate breathing and ensure a stable airway. Higher doses are required for patients who overdosed on diphenoxylate, methadone, butorphanol, nalbuphine, or pentazocine. A naloxone infusion can be started in patients who need repeated doses to maintain respiration.

Nalmefene is a new agent on the market that can reverse opiate toxicity. This drug has a half-life of 4 to 8 hours. However, routine use of this longer-acting opiate antagonist is not recommended due to concerns about precipitating a prolonged period of opiate withdrawal.

**Starting dose of naloxone**

The usual starting dose of naloxone for adults ranges from 0.4 to 1 mg. Meanwhile, the starting dose for children is 0.1 mg/kg. The goal of naloxone administration is to reverse respiratory depression, not to "wake up" the individual. Naloxone should be administered slowly in suspected chronic opiate users, with doses of 0.04 to 0.4 mg given intravenously every 1 to 3 minutes. This approach ensures a more controlled reversal of opiate effects and reduces the risk of precipitating withdrawal symptoms.[32] Rapid administration of naloxone in these patients can trigger withdrawal, which is distressing for the patient and potentially places healthcare workers at risk of injury.

Before naloxone administration, the patient should receive 100% fraction of inspired oxygen assisted by bag-valve ventilation until they become more alert and cooperative or until naloxone is administered. The onset of naloxone’s action is immediate, with peak response occurring within 3 to 8 minutes. A repeat dose may be indicated if the patient continues to show signs of opiate toxicity.

Starting with a low dose of naloxone is important, typically 0.05 to 0.1 mg intravenously, gradually titrating upward to minimize the risk of withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, agitation, pain, and aspiration. This careful dosing is especially crucial in patients suspected of ingesting opiates combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines. Peripheral intravenous access may be difficult in some patients with opiate overdose and long-term OUD. In such cases, 2 mg of naloxone may be administered intramuscularly or intranasally. Even with this route, opiate toxicity is reversed within 5 to 10 minutes.

The half-life of naloxone is about 30 to 45 minutes, with a duration of action ranging from 90 to 180 minutes. These variations depend on the route of administration and dose. Patients should be monitored for any recurrence of opioid toxicity, as the initial drug effect may last longer than naloxone’s duration of action. An infusion may be started in patients requiring multiple bolus doses. The naloxone infusion dose is 3/4 of the amount required to reverse respiratory depression.[33]

Much higher doses of naloxone are usually needed to reverse toxicity in patients who have taken large doses of propoxyphene, methadone, diphenoxylate/atropine, or fentanyl. Repeat doses of 2 mg may be required every 3 to 4 minutes for a total of 10 mg. The diagnosis of opioid toxicity should be reconsidered in patients who fail to respond to 10 mg of naloxone. Many street opiate preparations are adulterated, and the response to naloxone may not always be complete. A steady naloxone infusion is generally preferred over intermittent dosing for treating large overdoses. However, a naloxone infusion should not be administered if intubation is necessary.[34][35][36] Clinicians must be ready to intubate if the patient remains in respiratory distress.

**Role of activated charcoal**

Activated charcoal may be used to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract in cases of oral opiate overdose, such as with body stuffers, if the patient is alert at the time of admission. Activated charcoal is typically effective only if administered within 1 hour of drug ingestion. However, opiates slow gastric motility, allowing activated charcoal to be given up to 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. Activated charcoal should be considered for all patients with opiate overdose in the absence of contraindications, such as vomiting and decreased mental status.

Activated charcoal should not be administered to patients with depressed mental status or any individual with airway concerns. Patients should not be intubated solely to administer activated charcoal.

**Bowel irrigation**

Whole bowel irrigation may be considered for individuals who have ingested drug packets containing opiates, as in the case of a body packer. However, no controlled studies confirm that this treatment offers any benefits or improves outcomes. Whole bowel irrigation is not recommended for patients showing signs of ileus, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or an unprotected airway.

**Additional measures**

Some patients with opiate toxicity may not respond to high-dose naloxone treatment. Anecdotal reports suggest that buprenorphine may be beneficial if the cause is determined to be an opiate and the patient is in respiratory arrest.

**Intranasal administration of naloxone**

Naloxone is highly effective when administered promptly, but its use has traditionally been limited to physicians and paramedics. With the rise in opioid overdoses, intranasal medication administration by bystanders is currently being advocated. Evidence supporting the efficacy of out-of-hospital naloxone administration is promising. The bioavailability of concentrated naloxone nasal spray has been shown to be around 25%. Fifty percent absorption occurs within 6 to 8 minutes, with maximum blood concentration reached at 20 minutes, making it a viable option for community and prehospital use.

A retrospective study of Basic Life Support (BLS) crews administering prehospital intranasal naloxone over 6 years found that 95% of patients who received treatment showed clinical benefits before arrival. Less than 10% of patients required additional doses in the emergency department, and 70% were eventually discharged.

**Opioid poisoning in children**

The dose of naloxone for children who are younger than 5 or weigh less than 20 kg is 0.1 mg/kg. For children who are older than 5 or weigh more than 20 kg, the dose ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg. Repeat dosing may be required every 3 to 4 minutes, up to a maximum cumulative dose of 10 mg of naloxone. Repeat dosing is often necessary when the child has ingested longer-acting opiates like methadone. A continuous naloxone infusion may be started, but caution must be taken to avoid overhydration, which could lead to pulmonary edema. The pharmacy may assist with determining the correct concentration of fluid and naloxone for safe administration, but repeat bolus dosing may be safer if a concentrated infusion is unavailable.

**Use of combined buprenorphine and naloxone**

Buprenorphine, in combination with naloxone, is widely available and used to treat OUD in the outpatient setting. Buprenorphine acts as a partial agonist and antagonist at the opioid receptor. Anecdotal data indicate that the risk of overdose is lower with buprenorphine/naloxone compared to methadone. Naloxone has no oral bioavailability and is included in the formulation to deter intravenous use. Unfortunately, the sublingual preparation of buprenorphine and naloxone may also be easily abused.

**Naloxone adverse effects**

Naloxone has demonstrated a very safe side effect profile. Studies on opioid-naive patients who received large doses of the drug showed no significant effects. However, naloxone can trigger acute opioid withdrawal symptoms in opioid-tolerant patients. These symptoms may include sudden aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting, which occur in approximately 30% of patients. Most symptoms are mild and short-lived, with fewer than 1% of patients requiring admission. Acute withdrawal is more likely with higher doses of naloxone.

A rare but potential side effect of naloxone is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, which is thought to result from a sudden catecholamine surge, typically following the administration of high doses of naloxone. Treatment involves positive pressure ventilation, starting with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) and escalating to endotracheal intubation if necessary.[37]

**Inpatient Care**

Most patients who overdose on opiates and experience a reversal with naloxone are admitted for observation for at least 12 to 24 hours. Naloxone's duration of action is approximately 1 hour, and long-acting opiates may continue to cause sedation and respiratory depression. These patients are best monitored on a specialized floor. The majority of patients on heroin overdose are admitted due to the risk of acute lung injury, which often presents early. Individuals who are asymptomatic after a heroin overdose may not require 24-hour monitoring but still need 6 to 12 hours of observation before discharge, provided their vital signs remain stable.

Admission is also recommended for patients requiring multiple doses or prolonged intravenous infusions of naloxone to maintain respiratory function. Admission is the safest course of action if the patient’s clinical stability is in question.

**Outpatient Care**

Given the association of opiate use with sudden respiratory difficulty, many healthcare professionals now advocate for take-home naloxone. Having naloxone at home is particularly beneficial for individuals at high risk of narcotic overdose.

**Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act**

The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act updates federal guidelines to expand access to evidence-based treatments for the opioid epidemic. This act enables all healthcare providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD, similar to how they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act aims to reduce the stigma surrounding OUD treatment and promote its integration into general healthcare settings.

The MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program as of December 2022. DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority are now permitted to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD within their practice, provided it aligns with applicable state laws. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) encourages providers to take advantage of this change. Practitioners previously registered under the DATA-Waiver program automatically receive updated DEA registration certificates reflecting this change, with no action required on their part.

Practitioners are no longer limited in the number of patients with OUD they may treat with buprenorphine. Additionally, separately tracking patients treated with buprenorphine or the number of prescriptions written is not required.

Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescriber's DEA number without requiring a DATA 2000 waiver. However, depending on the pharmacy, dispensing software may still prompt for X-Waiver information to proceed. Practitioners must also adhere to any applicable state regulations regarding the treatment of patients with OUD.
