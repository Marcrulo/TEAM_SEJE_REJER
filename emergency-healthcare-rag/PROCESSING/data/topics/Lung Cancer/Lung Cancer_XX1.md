## Continuing Education Activity

Lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinoma refers to tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or within the bronchi. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. It is estimated that there are 225,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States annually, and approximately 160,000 die because of lung cancer. It is interesting to note that lung cancer was a relatively rare disease at the beginning of the 20th century. Its dramatic rise in later decades is attributable primarily to the increase in smoking among both males and females. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of lung cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**

  * Describe the pathophysiology of lung cancer.

  * Review the causes of lung cancer.

  * Summarize the different types of lung cancers.

  * Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lung cancer.

## Introduction

Lung cancer or bronchogenic carcinoma refers to tumors originating in the lung parenchyma or within the bronchi. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Since 1987, lung cancer has been responsible for more deaths in women than breast cancer. It is estimated that there are 225,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States annually, and approximately 160,000 people die because of lung cancer. It is interesting to note that lung cancer was a relatively rare disease at the beginning of the 20th century. Its dramatic rise in later decades is mostly attributable to the increase in smoking among both males and females.[1][2]

## Etiology

Smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer. It is estimated that 90% of lung cancer cases are attributable to smoking.[3] The risk is highest in males who smoke. The risk is further compounded with exposure to other carcinogens, such as asbestos. There is no correlation between lung cancer and the number of packs smoked per year due to the complex interplay between smoking and environmental and genetic factors. The risk of lung cancer secondary to passive smoking increases by 20 to 30%.[3] Other factors include radiation for non-lung cancer treatment, especially non-Hodgkins lymphoma and breast cancer.[4] Exposure to metals such as chromium, nickel, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is also associated with lung cancer. Lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis increase the risk of lung cancer independent of smoking.[5]

Asbestos and radon are established risk factors for lung cancer as well. Asbestos exposure, particularly occupational exposure, increases the risk for lung cancer in a dose-dependent manner but varies according to the type of asbestos fiber. Nonoccupational asbestos exposure risk is less defined. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set standards for low-level acceptable nonoccupational asbestos exposure, stating that the health risk to occupants of a building in which asbestos is undisturbed without respirable particles is not significant.[6] Radon exposure in uranium miners was associated with a small but significant risk of lung cancer.[7] Radon has also been shown to accumulate in homes as a decay product of uranium and radium. A meta-analysis of European studies reported appreciable hazards from residential radon, particularly for smokers, and was responsible for approximately 2% of all deaths from lung cancer in Europe.[8]

## Epidemiology

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 12.4% of all cancers diagnosed worldwide, and is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths.[9] The American Cancer Society estimates an annual incidence of more than 234,000 new lung cancer cases and over 154,000 lung cancer-associated deaths in the United States.[9] According to the Global Cancer Statistics report from 2020, lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths.[10]

Historically, the lung cancer epidemic seems to involve the developed world only. Recent data suggest that the incidence of lung cancer is dramatically rising, with nearly half of new cases, 49.9%, diagnosed in the underdeveloped world.[11] In the United States, mortality is high in men compared to women. Overall, there is no racial difference in the incidence of lung cancer, but the age-adjusted mortality rate is higher in African American males than their Caucasian counterparts. No such distinction exists between women.[3]

## Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of lung cancer is very complex and incompletely understood. It is hypothesized that repeated exposure to carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke leads to dysplasia of lung epithelium. If the exposure continues, it leads to genetic mutations and affects protein synthesis.[12] This, in turn, disrupts the cell cycle and promotes carcinogenesis. The most common genetic mutations responsible for lung cancer development are _MYC_ , _BCL2_ , and  _p53_ for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and _EGFR_ , _KRAS_ ,__ and _p16_ for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).[13][14]

Histopathological classification of lung cancers is based on cellular and molecular subtypes, which is an essential part of diagnosing and managing lung cancers. The 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) classification system of lung tumors divides the lung cancers as follows:

  * Precursor glandular lesions

  * Adenocarcinomas

  * Adenosquamous carcinomas

  * Squamous precursor lesions

  * Squamous cell carcinomas

  * Large cell carcinomas

  * Sarcomatoid carcinomas

  * Lung neuroendocrine neoplasms

  * Salivary gland-type tumors

  * Neuroendocrine tumors

  * Neuroendocrine carcinomas

  * And other epithelial tumors

According to the WHO, identifying histologic features, measuring the depth of invasion, and mode of spread is of prognostic value. For example, they state that tumor spread through air spaces is associated with a higher recurrence rate after limited resections and should be reported on pathological evaluation. Also, the previously described clear cell, rhabdoid, and signet ring subtypes have been discontinued by the most recent WHO classification as they appear to be cytologic features that can occur in any adenocarcinomas. The WHO classification places significant emphasis on immunohistochemical staining to classify cancers that may not have typical cytologic features on light microscopy. In the 2015 WHO classification system, poorly differentiated carcinomas were reclassified as squamous cell carcinomas if they had p40 expression; as adenocarcinomas with solid subtype if they had thyroid transcription factor 1 expression; and neuroendocrine carcinomas if they had chromogranin and synaptophysin positivity. 

**Precursor Glandular Lesions**

These include atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and adenocarcinoma in situ. AAH is a preinvasive lesion for lung adenocarcinoma and generally measures 5 mm or less. Adenocarcinoma in situ can be mucinous or nonmucinous and is generally a localized lesion of less than or equal to 3 cm. It shows a "lepidic" growth pattern defined as growth-restricted along the alveolar structures. It is noninvasive and shows intact alveolar septae. 

**Adenocarcinoma**

Adenocarcinoma pathology consists of either neoplastic gland formation, pneumocyte marker expression (thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) with or without napsin expression, or intracytoplasmic mucin. It is further classified based on the extent and architecture of the neoplastic gland formation as mucinous or nonmucinous. Acinar, papillary, micropapillary, lepidic, and solid are nonmucinous subtypes. Pathological identification of these subtypes is important for prognosis. Solid, micropapillary, and cribriform (a subtype of acinar nonmucinous adenocarcinoma) patterns have adverse prognostic significance.[15] Although mucinous adenocarcinomas can have papillary, micropapillary, solid, and cribriform architecture, the WHO does not make any grading recommendations for mucinous carcinomas based on the growth patterns in a tumor. Other less frequent forms of adenocarcinoma include colloid, enteric-like, lymphoepithelial, and fetal. 

Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) is a small, solitary adenocarcinoma less than or equal to 3 cm with minimal invasion (less than 5 mm) and a predominant lepidic growth pattern, resembling other similar precursor glandular lesions. If the invasion is greater than 5 mm, it is defined as lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma. Invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma, previously described as mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, comprises mucinous lesions that cannot be classified as MIA. If more than 10% of mucinous and nonmucinous growth patterns are present, the lesion should be classified as mixed adenocarcinoma. 

**Adenosquamous Carcinoma**

Adenosquamous carcinomas are lung tumors with more than 10% glandular and squamous components. This is an uncommon and highly aggressive lung tumor, and current recommendations propose adjuvant chemotherapy even in Stage I radically resected tumors with whole-brain postoperative prophylactic radiotherapy due to the high risk of recurrence and brain metastasis with this subtype.[16]

**Squamous Cell Carcinoma**

Squamous cell pathology is defined by the presence of keratin and/or intercellular desmosomes on cytology or by immunohistochemistry (IHC) evidence of p40, p63, CK5, CK5/6, or desmoglein expression. Subtypes of squamous cell carcinoma include nonkeratinizing, keratinizing, and basaloid. Squamous cell carcinomas show extensive central necrosis with resulting cavitation. Squamous cell cancers can present as Pancoast tumors and hypercalcemia. A Pancoast tumor is a tumor in the superior sulcus of the lung. The brain is the most common site of recurrence postsurgery in cases of Pancoast tumors.

**Large Cell Carcinoma**

Large cell carcinoma (LCC) is a malignant epithelial neoplasm that does not have cytologic features consistent with glandular, squamous, or neuroendocrine cancers. They do not typically express p40 and TTF-1 on immunohistochemistry and lack cytologic features of small cell carcinoma. Typically LCC is comprised of round to polygonal cells with prominent nucleoli. The cells are large with abundant cytoplasm that does not have any defining features. LCC is a diagnosis of exclusion.[17]

**Sarcomatoid Carcinoma**

These are rare carcinomas that exhibit malignant epithelial components and features that suggest sarcomas. Subtypes include pleomorphic carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. 

**Small Cell Carcinoma**

Small cell carcinoma (SCLC) is composed of round, oval, or angulated cells, with a small amount of cytoplasm and size roughly that of a resting lymphocyte. No distinct nucleoli are seen. SCLCs are extensively necrotic. They usually stain positive with chromogranin or synaptophysin. The WHO previously classified SCLC into three cell subtypes: oat cell, intermediate cell, and combined cell (SCLC with NSCLC component, squamous, or adenocarcinoma). However, studies have shown that such classification does not have much clinical significance or prognostic value.[18]

## History and Physical

No specific signs and symptoms exist for lung cancer. Most patients already have advanced disease at the time of presentation. Lung cancer symptoms occur due to local effects of the tumor, such as cough due to bronchial compression by the tumor due to distant metastasis, stroke-like symptoms secondary to brain metastasis, paraneoplastic syndrome, and kidney stones due to persistent hypercalcemia.[19]

Cough is present in 50 to 75% of patients with lung cancer.[2] Cough productive of large volumes of thin, mucoid secretions is seen in mucinous adenocarcinoma. In some cases, especially those with exophytic bronchial masses, a cough may signify secondary post-obstructive pneumonia. Hemoptysis is present in 15 to 30% of patients with lung cancer.[2] Chest pain is present in approximately 20 to 40% of patients with lung cancer, and dyspnea may be present in as many as 25 to 40% of the cases at the time of diagnosis.[2] These symptoms, however, may be primarily due to lung cancer or due to underlying bronchopulmonary disease.

Pleural involvement in lung cancer can manifest as pleural thickening/nodules or a malignant pleural effusion. During the course of their illness, approximately 10 to 15% of patients with lung cancer will have a malignant pleural effusion, with some showing a unilateral pleural effusion as the only presenting feature.[20] Bronchogenic carcinoma with associated ipsilateral malignant pleural effusion is considered unresectable; however, it must be noted that not all pleural effusions in patients with lung cancer are malignant.[21] A benign pleural effusion may occur due to lymphatic obstruction, post-obstructive pneumonitis, or atelectasis. If two consecutive cytology specimens are negative for malignancy in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, surgical thoracoscopy or medical pleuroscopy is recommended to evaluate the pleural space before surgical resection of a primary lesion.[22] Medical pleuroscopy has a sensitivity of greater than 90% for detecting malignancy when present in patients with bronchogenic carcinomas.[23]

Superior vena cava syndrome with dilated neck veins, edema of the face, neck, and upper extremities, and a plethoric appearance is a common feature of small cell lung cancer. It might be the primary presentation of the disease. The chest radiograph will show widening of the mediastinum or a right hilar mass.[24] As stated above, lung cancers in the superior sulcus present as Pancoast syndrome. This presents as shoulder pain, Horner syndrome, and evidence of bony destruction, with atrophy of hand muscles.

Metastasis from lung cancer to bone is frequently symptomatic, and patients may present with bone pain at the site of metastasis in the setting of elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and hypercalcemia. Up to 20% of the patients with non-small cell lung cancer may have bone pain secondary to metastasis on initial presentation;[25] whereas the percentage is as high as 30 to 40% in patients with small-cell lung cancer.[26] Imaging usually reveals osteolytic lesions with vertebral bodies as the most common site of metastasis. Adrenal metastases also occur in lung cancer, but they are rarely symptomatic and are usually seen on staging. However, not all adrenal lesions are malignant lesions, and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is recommended to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal lesions.[27] Brain metastasis is another common feature of lung cancer in small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). In SCLC, brain metastases may be present in as high as 20 to 30% of the patients at diagnosis.[28] Other common sites of metastases in lung cancer include the liver, which is usually only symptomatic in advanced disease. 

**Paraneoplastic Syndromes Associated with Lung Cancer**

Symptomatic hypercalcemia secondary to lung cancer may be due to secretion of the parathyroid hormone-related protein or due to extensive bony metastases. They present with anorexia, nausea, constipation, and lethargy as typical symptoms of hypercalcemia and have an overall poor prognosis as they tend to be associated with advanced disease.[29] The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is associated with SCLC and presents with symptoms of hyponatremia. 

Neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes are immune-mediated syndromes associated with SCLC and include Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), encephalomyelitis, limbic encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia, sensory neuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy.[30] Ectopic adrenal corticotropin production can cause Cushing syndrome and is associated with SCLC, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and carcinoid tumors of the lung, and it portends a worse prognosis.[31] Other extrapulmonary clinical manifestations of lung cancers include hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis.
