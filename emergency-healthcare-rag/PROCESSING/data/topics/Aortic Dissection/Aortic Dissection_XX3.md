## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnoses of aortic dissection include the following conditions:

  * Myocardial infarction

  * Aortic aneurysm

  * Cardiac tamponade (from another cause)

  * Esophageal rupture (Boerhaave syndrome)

  * Spontaneous pneumothorax

  * Pulmonary embolism

  * Stroke or transient ischemic attack

## Prognosis

The prognosis of aortic dissection varies significantly depending on multiple factors, including the type and location of the dissection, timing of intervention, and presence of complications. Acute aortic dissection is associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly when diagnosis and management are delayed. A prompt and accurate diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment can markedly improve survival outcomes.

**Prognosis Based on Dissection Type**

  * **Stanford type A dissections**
    * Mortality without treatment 
      * Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the high risk of fatal complications, such as cardiac tamponade, aortic rupture, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Without intervention, the mortality rate increases by 1% to 2% per hour within the first 24 to 48 hours, reaching nearly 50% by the end of the first week.

    * Surgical mortality 
      * With prompt surgical repair, the in-hospital mortality rate for type A dissections is around 15% to 30%, depending on factors such as patient age, presence of comorbidities, and intraoperative complications. Despite successful surgical intervention, long-term mortality remains high due to risks of recurrence, progressive aortic disease, and associated complications.

    * Long-term outcomes 
      * The 5-year survival rate after surgical repair is approximately 70% to 80%, while the 10-year survival rate decreases to around 50% to 60%. Late mortality is often due to complications such as aortic aneurysms, redissection, and cardiovascular events.

  * **Stanford type B dissections**
    * Prognosis with medical management 
      * Uncomplicated type B dissections are typically managed conservatively with blood pressure control. The in-hospital mortality rate for medically managed type B dissections is around 10% to 15%. Patients who remain stable during the acute phase have a relatively favorable short-term prognosis.

    * Prognosis with complications 
      * Complicated type B dissections, such as those associated with malperfusion syndromes, rupture, or rapid expansion, carry a higher risk of adverse outcomes. In these cases, in-hospital mortality can exceed 30% to 40% if not promptly treated with endovascular or surgical intervention.

    * Long-term outcomes 
      * The 5-year survival rate for type B dissections is approximately 75% to 85%, but patients are at increased risk of aortic aneurysm formation, redissection, and rupture over time. Regular imaging surveillance and blood pressure control are critical to improving long-term prognosis.

**Prognostic Factors**

Several clinical and anatomical factors influence the prognosis of patients with aortic dissection. Time to diagnosis and treatment is paramount, particularly for type A dissections, as delays in intervention significantly increase the risk of fatal outcomes due to rapid disease progression and life-threatening complications. The extent and location of the dissection also play a crucial role in prognosis, with dissections involving the aortic arch or extending into the abdominal aorta carrying a higher risk of complications, including organ malperfusion, neurologic deficits, and increased surgical complexity. The presence of complications such as pericardial tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, stroke, or malperfusion syndromes is strongly associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality. Patient demographics and comorbidities, such as advanced age, history of hypertension, connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome), and chronic kidney disease, further contribute to a worse prognosis. In particular, patients with genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome have an elevated risk of redissection and aneurysm formation, necessitating closer monitoring and follow-up. Hemodynamic status at presentation is a critical prognostic factor. Hypotension or shock at the time of diagnosis indicates severe complications, such as aortic rupture or tamponade, and is linked to a markedly increased risk of mortality. Similarly, surgical and postoperative complications, including neurologic deficits like stroke or spinal cord ischemia, renal failure, or prolonged intubation, are associated with elevated perioperative mortality and adverse long-term outcomes.

Even after successful initial treatment, patients remain at risk for long-term complications, including redissection and aneurysm formation. Recurrent dissection or aneurysmal dilation at the site of the initial dissection or other segments of the aorta is a significant concern, particularly in patients with residual dissection in the descending aorta or those with connective tissue disorders. Chronic aortic enlargement due to a residual false lumen can lead to progressive dilation, rupture, or the need for reintervention. Furthermore, these patients are at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure, particularly if the dissection involves the coronary arteries or aortic valve. Up to 20% to 30% of patients may require reintervention within 5 years due to recurrent dissection, aneurysm repair, or complications arising from the initial surgical or endovascular procedure. Regular follow-up with imaging and diligent management of modifiable risk factors is crucial to mitigating these risks and improving long-term outcomes.

**Long-Term Complications and Recurrence Risk**

Despite successful initial treatment, patients with aortic dissection remain at risk for long-term complications. One of the primary concerns is the possibility of redissection or aneurysm formation, either at the site of the initial dissection or in other segments of the aorta. This risk is particularly elevated in patients with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, or those with residual dissection in the descending aorta, which can predispose them to subsequent aortic pathology. Chronic aortic enlargement is another significant issue, particularly in patients with a persistent false lumen. Over time, the false lumen can lead to progressive aortic enlargement, ultimately resulting in aneurysmal dilation and, in severe cases, rupture or the need for additional surgical or endovascular interventions. Close monitoring with serial imaging is essential to detect these changes early and plan for timely intervention if needed.

Patients who have experienced aortic dissection are also at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. This risk is especially prominent if the initial dissection involves the coronary arteries or the aortic valve, which can compromise cardiac function over time. Managing cardiovascular risk factors aggressively and maintaining regular follow-up are crucial for these patients. Reintervention rates are relatively high in this population, with up to 20% to 30% of patients requiring additional procedures within 5 years of the initial event. Reinterventions may be necessary due to recurrent dissection, aneurysm repair, or complications stemming from the initial surgical or endovascular approach. Long-term care and diligent follow-up are essential components of managing these patients to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of severe complications.

**Prognosis and Quality of Life**

Results from several studies indicate that outcomes are significantly improved when managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, which may include a cardiologist, intensivist, pulmonologist, nephrologist, cardiac surgeon, interventional radiologist, and anesthesiologist. Each member of this team plays a critical role in addressing the complex, multisystem nature of aortic dissection. Pharmacists are also integral in patient education, particularly regarding the importance of blood pressure control and medication adherence, which are crucial in preventing complications and disease progression. Notably, outcomes are generally better in high-volume centers, which handle more than 5 aortic dissection cases per year, compared to smaller centers that perform fewer procedures.[23][24][25]

Despite advances in surgical and endovascular techniques that have improved survival rates, the quality of life and functional status of survivors can be compromised. Persistent pain, reduced exercise capacity, and psychological effects such as anxiety and depression are common among patients who have experienced an aortic dissection. Long-term management includes lifestyle modifications, stringent blood pressure control, and regular follow-up with imaging to detect complications early and prevent disease progression. Overall, the prognosis of aortic dissection is largely influenced by early recognition, timely intervention, and diligent long-term monitoring. Comprehensive multidisciplinary care and patient adherence to treatment plans are essential to improving survival and reducing morbidity in this high-risk population.

## Complications

Common complications of aortic dissection include: 

  * Multiorgan failure

  * Stroke

  * Myocardial infarction

  * Paraplegia

  * Renal failure

  * Amputation of extremities

  * Bowel ischemia

  * Tamponade

  * Acute aortic regurgitation

  * Compression of superior vena cava

  * Death

Endoleak is another common and significant complication in about 25% of patients after graft placement. An endoleak is the leakage of blood into an excluded aneurysmal sac, a term introduced by White et al. This complication can lead to aneurysm rupture over time, highlighting the need for regular imaging follow-ups for all patients after EVAR, as endoleaks may develop at any point.[26] CTA is the preferred imaging method for ongoing monitoring after EVAR. Endoleaks are categorized into 5 types, with the classification based on the source of the blood flow, which has a critical impact on subsequent patient management (see **Image.** Endoleak Types).[27] The type and location of endoleaks determine the management plan. Endoleaks are classified as:

  * Type I 
    * Leakage at the attachment sites due to insufficient sealing 
      * IA: Proximal attachment leak

      * IB: Distal attachment leak

      * IC: Occurs with an aorto-mono-iliac graft and femoro-femoral bypass from the contralateral nongrafted iliac artery

  * Type II 
    * Leakage through collateral vessels, such as the lumbar, inferior mesenteric, or internal iliac arteries

  * Type III 
    * Leakage resulting from defects in the graft, including fractures or holes (mechanical failure of the graft)

  * Type IV 
    * Leakage with no apparent source, attributed to graft porosity

  * Type V 
    * Aneurysm expansion without visible leakage (endotension)

## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

**Postoperative and Long-Term Management**

After surgical or endovascular repair, patients require ongoing management to prevent recurrence and monitor for late complications:

  * Blood pressure control 
    * Lifelong antihypertensive therapy is indicated to maintain a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg. Beta-blockers remain the first-line agents, and other antihypertensives, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or calcium channel blockers, may be added based on patient tolerance and comorbidities.

  * Imaging surveillance 
    * Regular imaging follow-up with CT, MRI, or echocardiography is critical to monitor for aneurysm formation, residual dissection, or complications like endoleaks. Initial follow-up is typically performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge, with annual imaging afterward.

  * Lifestyle modifications 
    * Patients should be advised to avoid strenuous physical activity and heavy lifting to prevent increased aortic wall stress. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, weight management, and adherence to antihypertensive therapy, are crucial for long-term outcomes.

  * Management of complications 
    * Late complications such as aneurysm development, recurrent dissection, or graft complications may necessitate reintervention. Decisions should be guided by imaging findings and clinical symptoms. 

## Deterrence and Patient Education

**Risk Factor Modification**

Patients should be educated about the various modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors contributing to AAD's development. This includes:

  * Hypertension management 
    * Hypertension is the most significant modifiable risk factor for AAD. Strict blood pressure control is crucial, typically with a target systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg. Patients should understand the importance of adhering to antihypertensive medications, dietary modifications (eg, reduced sodium intake), regular exercise, and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption.

  * Avoidance of stimulants 
    * Cocaine and other stimulant drugs increase blood pressure and the risk of aortic dissection. Patient education should emphasize avoiding these substances and seeking help for substance use disorders.

  * Atherosclerosis management 
    * Patients should be counseled on the importance of cholesterol management, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight. This involves regular lipid monitoring, dietary counseling, and smoking cessation support, as smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and increases the risk of dissection.

  * Screening for connective tissue disorders 
    * Individuals with a family history of connective tissue disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) or genetic predispositions should undergo regular cardiovascular screening. Identifying these conditions early allows for tailored monitoring and preventive strategies, such as early elective surgical intervention in cases of progressive aortic dilation.

**Patient Awareness of Symptoms**

Early recognition of AAD symptoms is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality. Patients should be educated to recognize and respond promptly to symptoms, including:

  * Patients should understand that sudden, severe chest or back pain—often described as tearing or ripping—is a hallmark symptom of AAD and warrants immediate medical attention.

  * They should be aware that symptoms such as sudden loss of consciousness, stroke-like symptoms, or limb weakness may indicate an aortic dissection involving branch vessels, necessitating urgent evaluation.

  * Awareness of symptoms like shortness of breath, new onset of heart murmur, or signs of limb ischemia can be vital for early detection.

Encouraging patients to seek emergency care rather than waiting or self-medicating is essential for improving outcomes.

**Medical Therapy Adherence and Long-term Monitoring**

For patients with known aortic aneurysms or those at risk for AAD, long-term management and monitoring are key to preventing progression and complications:

  * Medication adherence 
    * Beta-blockers are frequently prescribed to patients at risk for AAD to reduce heart rate and aortic wall stress. Patients should be counseled on the importance of adhering to their prescribed medications and understanding the rationale behind each medication to enhance compliance.

  * Lifestyle adjustments 
    * Physical activities that significantly increase blood pressure or cause Valsalva maneuvers (eg, heavy lifting and competitive sports) should be avoided, especially in patients with a known aortic aneurysm or prior dissection. Moderate exercise, such as walking, is encouraged only after consulting with a healthcare provider.

  * Regular follow-up and imaging 
    * Patients with connective tissue disorders or aortic aneurysms should have routine follow-ups and periodic imaging (eg, echocardiograms or CT/MRI) to monitor aortic size and integrity. Education should include the frequency and importance of these follow-ups, even without symptoms.

**Genetic Counseling and Screening**

For individuals with a family history of AAD or related connective tissue disorders, genetic counseling is crucial:

  * First-degree relatives of patients with a history of AAD should be screened for aortic abnormalities. Genetic testing may be recommended, and positive results warrant routine surveillance and preventive measures.

  * Women with a history of connective tissue disorders or aortic pathology should receive preconception counseling to assess the risk of aortic complications during pregnancy. Management strategies, such as elective repair prior to conception or high-risk obstetric care, should be discussed.

**Psychosocial Support and Patient Education**

The emotional burden of living with a risk for AAD or managing its aftermath can be significant. Providing patients and families with access to educational resources about AAD and support groups can improve coping mechanisms and adherence to management strategies.

**Emergency Plans**

Patients at high risk for AAD should have a clear emergency action plan. This includes:

  * Knowing the location of the nearest hospital with advanced imaging capabilities

  * Understanding when and how to call emergency services (eg, for sudden severe pain or neurological symptoms)

  * Having a summary of their medical history, including prior imaging results and medications, readily available for healthcare providers in case of an emergency

## Pearls and Other Issues

Despite optimal circumstances, diagnosing every case of AAD in the emergency department remains a significant challenge. One contributing factor is the variability in symptom severity, as some patients may present with relatively mild symptoms that do not immediately raise suspicion for AAD. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings may also mimic other conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome, leading to misdiagnosis. Another factor complicating diagnosis is the absence of expected physical exam findings, such as a pulse deficit or a widened mediastinum on chest x-ray, which are not always present even in confirmed cases of AAD. Every patient presenting with chest pain must be approached with the consideration that they could potentially have an AAD to minimize the risk of missed diagnoses. Establishing a detailed risk factor profile, maintaining a high index of suspicion, and being vigilant about atypical or subtle presentations are critical components of effective evaluation and diagnosis.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

Effective management of aortic dissection requires a coordinated, patient-centered approach involving a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including advanced clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other allied healthcare professionals. Each team member enhances patient outcomes and ensures safety. Clinicians, such as cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons, lead diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. At the same time, advanced clinicians and nurses provide continuous bedside monitoring, patient education, and early recognition of complications. Pharmacists contribute by optimizing pharmacologic therapies, ensuring medication safety, and counseling patients on medication adherence and blood pressure management, which is critical for long-term prognosis.

Open communication between team members is vital to improving outcomes.[22][28][29] Regular team meetings and a shared care plan help align treatment goals and strategies, minimizing the risk of errors and enhancing patient safety. This approach ensures that all providers are aware of the patient’s status, recent interventions, and any changes in management plans. Care coordination extends beyond the acute phase, with outpatient follow-up and rehabilitation planning guided by the team's collective expertise, including social workers and psychologists, to address psychosocial needs and support the patient’s return to daily life. By integrating the unique skills of each healthcare professional, maintaining open channels of communication, and fostering a collaborative environment, the interprofessional team can deliver comprehensive, high-quality care that enhances patient-centered outcomes and overall team performance.
