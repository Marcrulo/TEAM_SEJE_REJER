Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition characterized by the tearing of the aortic wall, creating a false lumen that can compromise blood flow to vital organs; this condition typically presents with sudden, severe chest or back pain and may lead to catastrophic complications such as aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, or organ ischemia. Early recognition, prompt imaging, and appropriate surgical or medical management are crucial for survival. Management involves a multifaceted approach, including blood pressure control, pain management, and potential surgical intervention, depending on the type and location of the dissection. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for complications like redissection, aneurysm formation, and cardiovascular events.

Clinicians participating in this course gain a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of aortic dissection and insights into recent advancements in treatment modalities and patient care strategies. The course enhances clinicians' ability to identify high-risk patients, interpret imaging findings, and apply evidence-based therapeutic interventions. Participants will also learn about the importance of interprofessional collaboration and effective communication that improves patient outcomes and ensures patient safety in complex cases.

## Introduction

Aortic dissection, though uncommon, is a catastrophic vascular disorder characterized by a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta, leading to the separation of the aortic wall layers. Blood enters between the intima and media, propagating the dissection either proximally or retrograde, resulting in compromised blood flow to vital organs. Acute aortic dissection carries extremely high mortality rates, with many patients dying before reaching emergency care. Patients with chronic aortic dissection, defined as a dissection present for more than 2 weeks, have a slightly better prognosis.

While the classic presentation of acute aortic dissection involves sudden, severe, “tearing” chest pain, subtle presentations often lead to missed diagnoses. Despite the literature, many aortic dissections are missed in the emergency department; only 15% to 43% of verified cases are accurately diagnosed at first presentation.[1][2][3] Without treatment, mortality approaches 50% within 48 hours of symptom onset. Despite its rarity, acute aortic dissection requires prompt diagnosis and multidisciplinary healthcare intervention, with better outcomes observed in high-volume centers utilizing experienced teams, “aorta code” protocols, and specialized aortic centers.[4] Further, implementing a multidisciplinary strategy with vascular surgery and cardiology expertise is essential to improving patient outcomes in these life-threatening cases. Aortic dissections are classified anatomically by 2 systems: the Stanford and DeBakey classification systems.

The Stanford system categorizes dissections into 2 types based on whether the ascending or descending part of the aorta is involved (see **Image.** Stanford Classification of Aortic Dissection). 

  * **Stanford Type A:** This**** involves the ascending aorta, regardless of the site of the primary intimal tear (see **Image.** Type A Aortic Dissection), and is defined as a dissection proximal to the brachiocephalic artery.

  * **Stanford Type B:** This originates distal to the left subclavian artery and involves only the descending aorta; the Society for Vascular Surgery and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons define Stanford type B dissections as those where the entry tear occurs beyond the origin of the innominate artery.[5]

The DeBakey system further subdivides dissections into 3 types based on the origin and extent of the dissection: 

  * **DeBakey Type 1:** Originates in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta

  * **DeBakey Type 2:** Originates in and is limited to the ascending aorta

  * **DeBakey Type 3:** Begins in the descending aorta and extends distally above the diaphragm (type 3a) or below the diaphragm (type 3b)

Ascending dissections (Stanford type A or DeBakey types 1 and 2) are nearly twice as common as descending dissections (Stanford type B or DeBakey type 3), necessitating an urgent, specialized approach to reduce the risk of fatal complications such as aortic rupture, stroke, or myocardial infarction (see **Image.** Aortic Dissection, Type A).[6]

## Etiology

Predisposing high-risk factors for nontraumatic aortic dissection include:

  * Hypertension (occurs in 70% of patients with distal Stanford type B dissections)

  * An abrupt, transient, severe increase in blood pressure (eg, strenuous weight lifting and use of sympathomimetic agents such as cocaine, ecstasy, or energy drinks)

  * Genetic conditions include: 
    * Marfan syndrome 
      * In an International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) review, Marfan syndrome was present in 50% of those younger than 40, compared with only 2% of older patients.

      * In patients with Marfan syndrome, cystic medial necrosis is seen in the tissues.

    * Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

    * Turner syndrome

    * Bicuspid aortic valve

    * Coarctation of the aorta

  * Preexisting aortic aneurysm

  * Atherosclerosis

  * Pregnancy and delivery 
    * This risk is compounded in pregnant women with connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome.

  * Family history

  * Aortic instrumentation or surgery (eg, coronary artery bypass, aortic or mitral valve replacement, and percutaneous stenting or catheter insertion)

  * Inflammatory or infectious diseases that cause vasculitis (eg, syphilis, cocaine use) [7]

## Epidemiology

Acute aortic dissection is a rare but life-threatening condition, with an incidence of 5 to 30 cases per 1 million people per year. This contrasts sharply with acute myocardial infarction, which has approximately 4400 cases per 1 million people annually. Aortic dissection accounts for 3 out of every 1000 emergency department presentations involving acute chest, back, or abdominal pain. The condition predominantly affects individuals between 40 and 70, with most cases occurring in patients aged 50 to 65. Approximately 75% of dissections happen in this age range, highlighting age as a key risk factor.

While men are 3 times more likely to develop aortic dissection than women, women often present later in the disease course and have worse outcomes.[8] The risk profile differs between older and younger patients: older patients are more likely to have hypertension, atherosclerosis, prior aortic aneurysm, or iatrogenic dissection, while younger patients, particularly those younger than 40, are more likely to have connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome. Type A dissections involving the ascending aorta are twice as common as type B dissections and are more likely to be fatal without urgent intervention. Hypertension is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor, present in about 75% of patients, while other risk factors include atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders, and previous cardiac surgery.

## Pathophysiology

Aortic dissection occurs when a tear in the intimal layer of the aortic wall allows blood to enter the space between the intima and media, creating a false lumen. The aortic wall has 3 layers: the intima, media, and adventitia. Chronic exposure to high pulsatile pressure and shear stress, especially in susceptible individuals, weakens these layers, leading to the initial intimal tear. This tear typically occurs in the ascending aorta, particularly in the right lateral wall, where shear forces are highest. The blood then flows into the space between the intima and media, expanding the false lumen.

In most cases, the dissection propagates either anterograde (distally) or retrograde (proximally). The direction of propagation dictates the complications that arise: distal propagation can obstruct blood flow to the major branches of the aorta, leading to ischemia in affected territories such as the coronary, cerebral, spinal, or visceral arteries. Proximal propagation, as seen in type A dissections, often causes life-threatening complications like acute aortic regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, or even rupture.[9] As the false lumen develops, it typically becomes larger than the true lumen, increasing the risk of aneurysm formation and eventual rupture if left untreated. The 3 most common sites for acute aortic dissection include:

  * The area approximately 2 to 2.5 cm above the aortic root (the most frequent site)

  * Just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery

  * Within the aortic arch

These dissections are highly lethal if not recognized and treated promptly, often leading to death due to aortic rupture or tamponade.

## Histopathology

Aortic dissection is an acute life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the intimal layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, creating a false lumen between the intima-media and media-adventitia layers (see **Image.** Aortic Dissection Seen in Histology). This process can lead to a sudden drop in systemic blood pressure and cause catastrophic complications such as hemopericardium and cardiac tamponade, which can result in sudden death.[10] The dissection commonly occurs in the outer one-third of the aortic media, a structurally vulnerable area due to chronic injury and repair processes often triggered by hemodynamic forces like hypertension (see **Image.** Histologic Image of Aortic Dissection).[11] The dissection can progress in anterograde or retrograde directions, potentially obstructing branches of the aorta and leading to ischemia in organs such as the brain, heart, or kidneys.

The media layer of the aorta, composed of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers, collagen fibers, and extracellular matrix components such as hyaluronic acid, undergoes pathological changes in the setting of chronic hypertension or genetic predisposition. These changes, collectively termed cystic medial degeneration, include:

  * Mucoid accumulation 
    * This occurs in the extracellular matrix and increases the interlamellar or translamellar space, creating the so-called “cystic degeneration” of the media that decreases vessel resistance. The main component of mucin accumulation is chondroitin-6-sulfate.[12]

  * Alteration of elastic fibers 
    * Under normal conditions, a dense meshwork of elastic fibers in the media maintains the aorta's structural integrity. These fibers provide elasticity and resistance to the constant pulsatile forces exerted by blood pressure. Alterations in these elastic fibers, such as fragmentation, thinning, and disorganization, compromise the aorta's ability to withstand these forces. 
      * Fragmentation of elastic fibers increases the spaces between the lamellar layers (translamellar spaces), weakening the aorta's mechanical strength and elasticity. This renders the vessel more prone to dissection, as the weakened wall can't resist the high shear forces of blood flow very well.

      * Thinning these fibers further weakens the vessel wall, widening the spaces between elastic fibers and reducing the aorta's overall resilience. This makes the aorta susceptible to dilation, aneurysm formation, and dissection.

      * Disorganization refers to the loss of the parallel arrangement of elastic fibers, which are normally aligned in an orderly fashion to withstand pressure. When disorganized, the fibers are haphazardly arranged and unable to function effectively, leading to a loss of structural cohesion and increasing the risk of tears within the aortic wall.

  * Altered smooth muscle cells 
    * Smooth muscle cells undergo nuclear loss and disorganization. 
      * Nuclear cell loss, so-called “smooth muscle cell necrosis,” can appear in bands or as wide areas where only the ghost cell contours are visible. The disarray of smooth muscle cells can be focal or nodular.

  * Laminar medial collapse 
    * The collapsing of elastic fibers represents “laminar medial necrosis” and is coupled with significant loss of interposed smooth muscle cells.

  * Collagen fibrosis 
    * Collagen fibers can become fibrotic; this is the least common process in degenerative aortic disease.

These findings are often combined and must be carefully recognized to accurately grade the degree of medial degeneration as mild, moderate, or severe. This grading is determined by evaluating the severity and distribution of the degenerative lesions observed within the aortic wall.[13][14] Each category reflects the extent of structural damage, including alterations in elastic fibers, smooth muscle cell integrity, and the extracellular matrix. Identifying these changes is crucial for understanding the underlying pathology and predicting potential outcomes, as more severe degeneration is associated with a higher risk of complications such as aortic dissection or rupture. Histopathological evaluation using stains like Verhoeff-Van Gieson, Alcian blue, and Masson trichrome can reveal the extent of these alterations. 

The vasa vasorum, a network of small vessels supplying the outer layers of the aortic wall, plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the media. Dysfunction of the vasa vasorum, such as obstruction or thickening, can lead to medial necrosis and contribute to the development of aortic dissection. Hypertension is the most important risk factor for medial degeneration and aortic dissection, causing intimal thickening, aortic stiffness, and damage to the elastic fibers.[15][16] Aging exacerbates these degenerative processes, with a loss of elastin, increased collagen deposition, and microcalcifications in the media, further increasing the risk in older populations.[17] This is the primary physiological reason for the high epidemiological correlation between age and aortic diseases such as aneurysms and dissection.[12] Genetic factors also contribute to aortic dissection risk. Conditions such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome result in altered elastic fiber meshwork, predisposing individuals to aneurysms and dissections. Additionally, congenital cardiovascular diseases like a bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and tetralogy of Fallot are associated with structural abnormalities of the aortic wall, further increasing the risk of dissection in affected individuals.
