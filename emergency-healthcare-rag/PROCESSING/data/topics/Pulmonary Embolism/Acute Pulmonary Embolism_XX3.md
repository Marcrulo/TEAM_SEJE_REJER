## Treatment / Management

**Initial Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolus**

**Supportive measures**

The initial approach to patients with PE should focus on supportive measures. Supplemental oxygen is indicated in patients with oxygen saturation <90%. Mechanical ventilation (noninvasive or invasive) should be utilized in unstable patients, but clinicians should be mindful of the adverse hemodynamic effects of mechanical ventilation.

Acute right ventricular failure is the leading cause of death in patients with hemodynamically unstable PE. Aggressive volume resuscitation in such patients can over-distend the right ventricular, worsen ventricular interdependence, and reduce cardiac output. Hence, in patients with massive PE, intravenous fluid resuscitation should be tried only in patients with collapsible inferior vena cava (IVC)/intravascular depletion. Vasopressors may be needed for hemodynamic support. Mechanical cardiopulmonary support devices, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, may be used in hemodynamically unstable patients with PEs.

**Anticoagulation**

Remembering that anticoagulation is the mainstay of treating acute PE is vital. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; fondaparinux) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be used for anticoagulation in acute PE. LMWH and fondaparinux are preferred since they lower the incidence of inducing major bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.[65][66] UFH is usually only used in patients with hemodynamic instability in whom primary reperfusion treatment might be required or in patients with renal impairment. Newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA) can also be used for anticoagulation in PE.

**Anticoagulation and hemodynamic stability**

The treatment for patients with suspected PE is stratified according to the type of PE (hemodynamically stable or unstable) and the clinician's suspicion index. Based on the revised Geneva or Wells score, patients are classified as having low, intermediate, or high suspicion of PE.

Anticoagulation is started before diagnostic imaging is obtained for hemodynamically stable patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE. For hemodynamically stable patients with a low clinical suspicion for PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 24 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients with an intermediate clinical suspicion of PE, if diagnostic imaging can be performed within 4 hours, clinicians should wait for imaging studies to establish a definitive diagnosis before starting treatment with anticoagulation. For hemodynamically stable patients in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated, IVC filter placement should be considered when the diagnosis of PE is confirmed.

For patients with a high clinical suspicion of PE who are hemodynamically unstable, emergent CTPA, portable perfusion scanning, or bedside transthoracic echocardiography should be performed whenever possible. Primary reperfusion treatment, usually thrombolysis, is the treatment of choice for patients with hemodynamically unstable acute PE. Surgical pulmonary embolectomy or percutaneous catheter-directed therapy are alternative reperfusion options in patients with contraindications to thrombolysis. Following reperfusion treatment and hemodynamic stabilization, patients recovering from high-risk PE can be switched from parenteral to oral anticoagulation.

**Reperfusion Strategies**

**Thrombolysis**

Thrombolysis has shown an effective reduction in pulmonary artery pressure and resistance in patients with PE compared to UFH alone; a decrease in right ventricular dilation on echocardiography assesses these improvements.[67][68] Thrombolysis is preferred when therapy can be instituted within 48 hours of symptom onset, but it has still shown benefit in patients whose symptoms began less than 14 days ago.[69] A meta-analysis suggested a significant reduction in mortality and recurrent PE using thrombolytics.[70]

Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) trial identified the benefits of thrombolysis in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE.[71] It demonstrated that thrombolysis was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hemodynamic decompensation or collapse, but it also showed an increased risk of severe bleeding with thrombolytics.[71][72]

Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include any prior intracranial hemorrhage, known structural intracranial cerebrovascular disease (eg, arteriovenous malformation), known malignant intracranial neoplasm, ischemic stroke within 3 months, suspected aortic dissection, active bleeding or bleeding diathesis, recent surgery encroaching on the spinal canal or brain, and recent significant closed-head or facial trauma with radiographic evidence of bony fracture or brain injury.

**Catheter-directed treatment**

Catheter-directed treatment involves the insertion of a catheter into the pulmonary arteries, which is then used for ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, suction embolectomy, rotational embolectomy, thrombus aspiration, or combining mechanical fragmentation with pharmacological catheter-directed thrombolysis. Different studies have shown a success rate of up to 87% for catheter-directed therapies.[73][74] Catheter-assisted embolectomy techniques carry the inherent risk of perforating the pulmonary arteries, leading to massive hemoptysis or cardiac tamponade. These complications are rare but fatal.

**Surgical embolectomy**

Surgical embolectomy is usually indicated in a patient with**** hemodynamically unstable PE in whom thrombolysis (systemic or catheter-directed) is contraindicated or in patients with failed thrombolysis.[75][76][77] For thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy, no difference in mortality is evident, but the thrombolysis group had a higher risk of stroke and repeated intervention.

**Vena cava filters**

Vena cava filters block the path of travel of emboli and prevent them from entering the pulmonary circulation. Filters are indicated in patients with venous thromboembolism who have an absolute contraindication to anticoagulants and in patients with recurrent VTE despite anticoagulation. Retrievable filters are preferred, such that after the contraindication has resolved, the filter can be removed, and patients should be anticoagulated. This is because the Prevention of Recurrent Pulmonary Embolism by Vena Cava Interruption (PREPIC) study showed that the insertion of a permanent vena cava filter was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent PE and a substantial increase in the risk of DVT, without a remarkable difference in the risk of recurrent VTE or death.[78]

**Long-Term Treatment and Prevention of Recurrence**

The aim of anticoagulation after the acute management of PE is to complete the treatment of the acute episode and prevent the recurrence of VTE over the long term. Clinical trials have assessed various durations of anticoagulant therapy with VKAs for VTE.[79][80][81] The findings of these studies established a treatment protocol for acute PE.

First, all patients with PE should receive 3 months or more of anticoagulant treatment. Second, after the anticoagulant treatment is stopped, the risk of recurrence is expected to be similar if anticoagulants are stopped after 3 to 6 months compared with more prolonged treatment periods (eg, 12 to 24 months). Third, extended oral anticoagulant treatment reduces the risk of recurrent VTE by ≤90%, but the risk of bleeding partially offsets this benefit. Oral anticoagulants are highly efficient in preventing recurrent VTE at the time of treatment, but after the discontinuation of treatment, they do not eliminate the risk of subsequent recurrence.[79]

Notably, about 30% of PEs are unprovoked. Unprovoked PE (ie, PE in the absence of an identifiable risk factor) is associated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of recurrence compared to patients who had a provoked PE.[82] Patients with persistent risk factors (eg, cancer or elevated antiphospholipid antibodies) have a higher rate of recurrence than those with transient risk factors (eg, immobilization, surgery, or trauma).[83]

Consequently, the optimal duration of anticoagulation remains uncertain and should be individualized. A minimum of 3 months is usually recommended, but a more extended period is required if the PE was unprovoked or persistent risk factors are evident.[82] This need for longer anticoagulation should be assessed at the end of 3 months by considering the patient's bleeding risk. Those with a high bleeding risk can limit therapy to 3 months. Special considerations are required for patients with active cancer, given their increased risk for a VTE event. Hence, cancer patients should receive an extended duration of anticoagulation if their bleeding risk remains acceptable (low or moderate bleeding risk). For cancer patients with PE, LMWH, and direct oral anticoagulants (eg, apixaban and rivaroxaban) are preferred over VKA.[84]

## Differential Diagnosis

Since PE has a very heterogeneous clinical presentation ranging from dyspnea to sudden cardiac arrest.[85] The differential diagnosis of PE is extensive and includes:

  * Acute coronary syndrome

  * Stable angina

  * Acute pericarditis

  * Congestive heart failure

  * Malignancy

  * Cardiac arrhythmias

  * Pneumonia

  * Pneumonitis

  * Pneumothorax

  * Vasovagal syncope

## Prognosis

Shock and right ventricular dysfunction confer a poor prognosis and predict mortality in patients diagnosed with PE.[63] Patients with PE and a coexisting DVT are also at an increased risk for death. While earlier reports reported a high rate of mortality following pulmonary infarction, a study from 2018 found the survival to discharge rate of those suffering from a pulmonary infarction to be high at around 97%.[86]

Several prognostic models have been designed, but the PE Severity Index (PESI) and the simplified PESI (sPESI) are the most commonly used. The PESI score predicts 30-day mortality in patients with an established diagnosis of PE.[87] The principal strength of the PESI and sPESI is identifying patients at low risk for 30-day mortality (PESI classes I and II).

**Original and Simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index**

The following parameters are utilized in each version of the PESI (original version [87]/simplified version [88]):

  * Age: 1 point (if age older than 80 years)

  * Male sex: +10 points/–

  * Cancer: +30 points/1 point

  * Chronic heart failure: +10 points/1 point

  * Chronic pulmonary disease: +10 points/1 point

  * Pulse rate ≥110 bpm: +20 points/1 point

  * Systolic BP <100 mm Hg: +30 points/1 point

  * Respiratory rate >30 breaths/min: +20 points/–

  * Temperature <36 °C: +20 points/–

  * Altered mental status: +60 points/–

  * Arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation <90%: +20 points/1 point 

Risk Stratification in PESI includes the following classes:

  * Class I: Points ≤65; low 30-day mortality risk from 1% to 6%.

  * Class II: Points 66 to 85; low mortality risk from 1.7% to 3.5%

  * Class III: Points 86 to 105; moderate mortality risk from 3.2% to 7.1%

  * Class IV: Points 106 to 125; high mortality risk from 4% to 11.4%

  * Class V: Points >125; high mortality risk from 10% to 24.5%

Risk Stratification in sPESI includes the following classes:

  * If 0 points: 1.0% 30-day mortality risk 

  * If ≥1 points: 10.9% 30-day mortality risk 

## Complications

The primary complications associated with PE include:

  * Recurrent thromboembolism

  * Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension

  * Right heart failure

  * Cardiogenic shock

PE, if left untreated, is associated with mortality of up to 30%. Studies have also suggested an increased risk of stroke, thought to be due to paradoxical embolism via a patent foramen ovale in patients with acute PE.[89]

**Recurrent Thromboembolism**

In the 1 to 2 weeks following diagnosis, patients may deteriorate and experience recurrence. Inadequate anticoagulation is the most common reason for recurrent venous thromboembolism while on therapy. 

**Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension**

The development of persistent or progressive dyspnea, particularly during the first 3 months to 2 years after diagnosis, should prompt the clinician to investigate the development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), which affects up to 5% of patients. In patients who remain persistently symptomatic months to years after an acute PE, follow-up CT, ventilation-perfusion scans, or echocardiography should be performed. These modalities demonstrate pulmonary hypertension in CTEPH.

On the V/Q scan, patients with CTEPH generally have at least 1 segmental or more significant mismatched ventilation-perfusion defect. For those patients with evidence of CTEPH on V/Q lung scanning, right heart catheterization, and pulmonary angiography are indicated to confirm pulmonary hypertension, quantify the degree of pulmonary hypertension, exclude competing diagnoses, define the surgical accessibility of the obstructing thrombotic lesions, and confirm that an acceptable component of the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is due to surgically accessible disease and not from distal obstruction or a secondary arteriopathy, for all patients with CTEPH, lifelong anticoagulant therapy is recommended. Also, early referral for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is highly recommended.

## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Individuals who have survived PEs often demonstrate decreases in multiple functional deficits, including respiratory volume, exercise tolerance, and reported quality of life. Approximately half of the survivors have persistent symptoms reducing their physical capacity. Continuing studies are needed to identify risk factors for individuals more likely to experience significant deficits following PE resolution.

The results of various studies have demonstrated different parameters for rehabilitation following PE and various program initiation times, ranging from weeks to months following diagnosis. These studies demonstrate minimal risks, with outcomes including a significant reduction in dyspnea and improvement in exercise capacity, functional mobility, and quality of life.[90][91] Rehabilitation services should work closely with the other care team members to identify deficits and develop a tailored care plan to address these deficits within safe parameters for each patient.

## Pearls and Other Issues

A timely diagnosis of PE is crucial because of the high associated mortality and morbidity, which may be prevented with early treatment. Patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of VTE and PE since the incidence of recurrent thromboembolism is high. Notably, 30% of untreated patients with PEs die, while only 8% die after timely therapy.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

Effective management of acute PE requires seamless interprofessional collaboration to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, and ensure patient safety. Pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) have emerged as an innovative approach to addressing the complexities of PE treatment. Composed of specialists in pulmonary medicine, critical care, cardiology, and cardiothoracic surgery, PERTs facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely intervention, ensuring that patients benefit from the collective expertise of diverse disciplines. Studies demonstrate that PERTs improve communication, streamline treatment efforts, and lead to more coordinated and effective care.

In the larger framework of an interprofessional team, nurses, pharmacists, and advanced practitioners play pivotal roles alongside physicians. As frontline clinicians, nurses contribute critical observations and ensure the timely implementation of prophylactic or therapeutic interventions. Pharmacists, as experts in anticoagulation therapy, provide essential input on drug selection, contraindications, and potential interactions, ensuring the safety and efficacy of treatment. Open communication and mutual respect among all healthcare professionals allow for comprehensive and well-informed decision-making, empowering each team member to contribute actively to patient care.

By fostering a collaborative environment, PERTs and interprofessional teams optimize care coordination and team performance. This approach emphasizes shared responsibilities, effective communication, and a unified strategy, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and improved safety in managing acute PE. Integrating diverse expertise within a cohesive team ensures patients receive timely, evidence-based, patient-centered care.
