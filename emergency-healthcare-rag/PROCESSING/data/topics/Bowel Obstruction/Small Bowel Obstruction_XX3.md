    * Crohn disease

  * **Functional**
    * Postoperative ileus

    * Ogilvie syndrome

    * Neuromuscular disorders

    * Medications

  * **Gynecological**
    * Endometriosis

    * Ovarian torsion or masses

  * **Vascular**
    * Mesenteric ischemia

    * Strangulated obstruction

  * **Metabolic and systemic**
    * Electrolyte imbalances

    * Diabetes mellitus

  * **Infectious**
    * Tuberculosis

    * Intraabdominal abscesses

  * **Pediatric-specific**
    * Malrotation with volvulus

    * Meckel diverticulum

    * Congenital atresia or stenosis

## Surgical Oncology

Neoplasms involving the peritoneal cavity, whether primary or metastatic and benign or malignant, represent a significant cause of SBO. The surgical and oncological management of such cases is tailored based on the type of tumor, its grade, stage, and the extent of peritoneal involvement. Treatment strategies may range from nonoperative medical management to a multimodality approach incorporating chemotherapy, radiation, and surgical intervention.

Palliative management plays a critical role for patients with advanced disease or those unsuitable for curative treatment. Approaches to palliate bowel obstruction include medications to reduce symptoms, nasogastric or intestinal decompression tubes, stoma formation, tube enterostomy, or the placement of intestinal stents.[36] These measures aim to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life, and manage complications associated with obstructive neoplastic conditions.

## Prognosis

The prognosis of SBO depends on several factors, including the underlying etiology, the patient's overall health status, the timeliness and appropriateness of treatment, and whether the obstruction is simple or complicated (eg, involving strangulation or perforation). Early diagnosis and prompt management significantly improve outcomes, while delays in treatment are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates.

**Simple SBO**

Patients with simple SBO, where there is no evidence of ischemia or perforation, generally have a favorable prognosis. Nonoperative management resolves most cases of partial or adhesional obstructions without surgery. Recovery is typically rapid if managed appropriately, with mortality rates in these cases being low (1%–5%). However, recurrent SBO remains a challenge, particularly in patients with prior surgeries and adhesions.

**Complicated SBO**

Complicated SBO, involving bowel strangulation, ischemia, or perforation, carries a significantly worse prognosis due to the risk of sepsis, peritonitis, and multiorgan failure. Mortality rates in these cases range from 10% to 40%, depending on the extent of bowel compromise and the speed of surgical intervention. Strangulated obstructions, which may progress to gangrene or perforation, demand urgent surgical treatment to minimize life-threatening complications.

**Prognostic Factors**

Several factors influence prognosis:

  * Etiology 
    * Adhesional SBO generally has a better prognosis than obstruction caused by malignancy or inflammatory bowel disease. Malignant bowel obstruction often indicates advanced disease, with limited curative options and a focus on palliative care.

  * Age and comorbidities 
    * Elderly patients and those with significant comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory disease, have higher risks of complications and mortality.

  * Timeliness of treatment 
    * Delays in diagnosis or intervention can worsen outcomes due to prolonged ischemia, necrosis, or systemic infection.

  * Extent of bowel damage 
    * The need for extensive bowel resection may lead to short bowel syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, and long-term morbidity.

**Long-Term Outcomes**

SBOs, particularly those caused by adhesions, can recur in about 20% of patients.[37] Preventive strategies, including minimally invasive surgery and adhesion barriers, can help reduce recurrence. Functional recovery after SBO varies; most patients resume normal bowel function, while some may experience prolonged ileus or other complications requiring further intervention.

**Survival Rates**

Long-term survival is excellent for simple SBO, especially when the obstruction is resolved nonoperatively or via uncomplicated surgery. In cases of malignant obstruction, survival is dictated by the stage and progression of the underlying malignancy, often requiring a palliative approach.

## Complications

SBO can lead to a range of complications, many of which are life-threatening if not promptly recognized and managed. These complications arise from the mechanical disruption of intestinal flow, vascular compromise, or secondary systemic effects.

**Mechanical and Local Complications**

  * Bowel ischemia and strangulation 
    * Increased intraluminal pressure compromises venous return, leading to bowel wall edema and, eventually, arterial ischemia. Strangulation occurs in approximately 25% of cases, particularly in closed-loop obstructions or hernias, and may result in necrosis, perforation, and gangrene.[38]

  * Perforation and peritonitis 
    * Persistent ischemia or bowel necrosis can lead to perforation, spilling luminal contents into the peritoneal cavity and causing bacterial peritonitis. This is a surgical emergency with a high mortality risk.

  * Adhesion formation 
    * Surgical or inflammatory causes of SBO may result in further adhesion formation, increasing the risk of recurrent obstructions.

  * Fistula formation 
    * Chronic obstructions or associated diseases, such as Crohn disease, can lead to abnormal connections between bowel loops or other organs, complicating management.

**Systemic Complications**

  * Sepsis and multiorgan failure 
    * Bacterial translocation across ischemic or necrotic bowel walls can lead to bacteremia, septic shock, and multiorgan dysfunction.

  * Electrolyte imbalance and dehydration 
    * Fluid sequestration within the bowel and vomiting lead to significant fluid and electrolyte losses, causing hypovolemia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting), or acidosis (with bowel ischemia or necrosis).

  * Malnutrition 
    * Prolonged obstruction, especially in chronic or partial cases, can result in malabsorption, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies.

**Postsurgical Complications**

  * **Anastomotic leak**
    * In cases requiring bowel resection, anastomotic leaks may occur, leading to peritonitis or abscess formation.

  * **Wound infection and dehiscence**
    * Postoperative infections and delayed wound healing are common complications following surgical intervention for SBO.

**Palliative Complications**

In patients managed palliatively for malignancy-related SBO, complications may include recurrent obstruction, inadequate symptom relief, and device-related issues such as stoma malfunction or infection.

## Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

Attention is given to ongoing correction of fluid and electrolytes, as well as intestinal decompression, until adequate bowel function returns during the postoperative period. Patients are monitored clinically for complications relating to the surgical intervention and with laboratory and radiology as needed. Contrast imaging may be used if there is concern for intestinal leaks or ongoing obstruction.

Weaning off medications such as opioids that may prolong postoperative ileus is an important aspect of pain management. Wound care is another important aspect of the postoperative period. Adequate mobilization and attention to deep venous thromboprophylaxis with mechanical thromboembolic devices and anticoagulants are important aspects of postoperative care. Depending on the period of SBO, as well as the extent of resection of the small bowel, there may be nutritional depletion, and care to monitor and augment nutrition with the parenteral route may be indicated until the return of bowel function.[39][40]

## Deterrence and Patient Education

**Deterrence Strategies**

Preventing SBO focuses on reducing modifiable risk factors and implementing measures to lower recurrence. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery face a heightened risk of adhesional SBO, which constitutes the majority of cases. Using minimally invasive surgical techniques, such as laparoscopy, can significantly decrease adhesion formation compared to open procedures. Additionally, adhesion barriers like sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose applied during surgery may further reduce the likelihood of adhesions. Early repair of abdominal wall hernias, particularly in high-risk individuals, can prevent incarcerated or strangulated hernias that often lead to SBO. Managing chronic medical conditions, such as Crohn disease or radiation enteritis, through adherence to prescribed treatment regimens can minimize complications like strictures and fistulas that predispose patients to obstruction.

**Patient Education**

Educating patients about SBO is essential for timely recognition and management of the condition. Individuals, especially those with prior abdominal surgeries, cancer, or chronic gastrointestinal disorders, should understand the symptoms and risk factors. Patients should be taught to recognize signs such as abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and an inability to pass stool or gas and to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.[41][42] Preventive measures, such as maintaining a balanced fiber-rich diet, can help avoid obstructions caused by constipation or bezoar formation. Those with a history of obstruction should avoid high-risk foods like persimmons or fibrous vegetables. Patients taking medications that impair bowel motility, such as opioids or anticholinergics, should discuss potential adjustments with their healthcare providers to reduce their risk.

**Postoperative Education**

Patients recovering from surgery for SBO require specific discharge instructions to prevent complications and ensure a smooth recovery. They should be vigilant for symptoms of recurrence, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting, and seek immediate care if these arise. Gradual reintroduction of a regular diet under medical supervision is crucial to reduce the risk of ileus or further obstruction. Regular follow-up appointments allow healthcare professionals to monitor recovery and manage any underlying conditions that could predispose patients to additional obstructions.

**Support and Resources**

Patients with chronic or recurrent SBO may benefit from support groups or counseling to address the physical and emotional challenges of their condition. Educational materials, such as brochures or online resources, empower patients to actively participate in their care and improve their understanding of prevention strategies. Healthcare teams can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications and recurrent SBO by fostering prevention, early symptom recognition, and effective patient-provider communication.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

Effective management of SBO requires a collaborative, patient-centered approach that leverages the skills and expertise of an interprofessional healthcare team. Clinicians are central in diagnosing SBO, ordering appropriate imaging, and determining surgical intervention needs. They must communicate clinical findings clearly, as well as anticipated management plans and possible complications, to other team members. Nurses are essential in monitoring patients’ vital signs, fluid balance, and the progression of symptoms, ensuring early detection of complications like ischemia or perforation. They manage nasogastric tube care and educate patients about the condition and its treatment. Pharmacists contribute by optimizing fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and antimicrobial therapy, particularly when addressing sepsis or preparing for surgical intervention.

Care coordination is pivotal in achieving optimal outcomes for patients with SBO. Clear and consistent communication among team members prevents delays in diagnosis or treatment. For example, radiologists provide timely and accurate imaging interpretation, which informs surgical versus nonoperative management decisions. In the perioperative setting, anesthesiologists work closely with surgeons to ensure patients are stabilized for surgery, while respiratory therapists assist patients with compromised pulmonary function due to abdominal distention. Social workers and case managers support discharge planning and facilitate access to follow-up care or resources for patients recovering from surgical intervention. This comprehensive strategy fosters a safety culture, improves patient outcomes, and enhances team performance by ensuring that every healthcare professional’s expertise is integrated into a unified, patient-focused care plan.
