## Continuing Education Activity

Myocardial infarction remains the leading cause of death worldwide. It is irreversible heart muscle necrosis resulting from decreased blood supply to the heart due to coronary artery occlusion. It is a significant but preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Clinically, myocardial infarction is diagnosed when the rise in cardiac biomarkers is detected along with evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, such as angina, EKG changes, or echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities. Anterior myocardial infarction carries greater mortality and morbidity when compared with other locations of acute myocardial infarction. However, advancements in diagnosis and treatment options have led to favorable outcomes. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of anterior myocardial infarction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating the condition.

**Objectives:**

  * Recognize the clinical presentation and ECG findings consistent with AWMI, distinguishing it from other types of myocardial infarction.

  * Implement timely reperfusion therapy, whether primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy, based on patient eligibility and available resources.

  * Apply evidence-based pharmacotherapy, including antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, beta-blockers, and statins, to optimize medical therapy and secondary prevention.

  * Coordinate the transition of care, including timely referral to cardiac rehabilitation programs, outpatient follow-up, and communication with primary care providers for long-term management and risk factor control.

## Introduction

Myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death globally.[1] It involves irreversible necrosis of the cardiac muscle due to reduced blood supply caused by the occlusion of coronary arteries. MI represents a significant but preventable contributor to morbidity and mortality rates.

Clinically, the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is established when there is an elevation in cardiac biomarkers, coupled with evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, which can include angina, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities. Anterior wall myocardial infarction (AWMI) occurs when there is a reduction in blood supply to the anterior wall of the heart, resulting from occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

Anterior myocardial infarction is associated with higher mortality and morbidity than other acute myocardial infarctions locations. It is linked to increased in-hospital mortality, greater reduction in left ventricle ejection fraction, and a higher incidence of congestive heart failure compared to infarctions occurring in other areas of the heart.[2][3]

Anterior myocardial infarction can be classified into different categories based on the anatomical location of the occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. These categories are as follows:

  1. Proximal LAD: Proximal to first septal perforator. On ECG findings, ST elevation is evident in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. It may also present as a new bundle branch block or a fascicular block.

  2. Mid-LAD: Distal to the first septal perforator but proximal to the first large diagonal branch. ECG findings reveal ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. Bundle branches are usually preserved.

  3. Distal LAD: Distal to large diagonal or large diagonal itself. ECG findings show ST elevation in leads V1-V4, I, aVL, V5, or V6.

## Etiology

**Plaque Rupture (also known as plaque fissure)** ****

Most AWMIs occur due to the disruption of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to exposure to thrombogenic contents. A thrombus forms when blood flow encounters the necrotic core within the coronary artery. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture, also known as plaque fissure, is characterized by a necrotic core with an eroded thin cap, followed by thrombus formation, and is the most common cause of anterior MI.[4]

Anterior myocardial infarction (MI) occurs due to sustained ischemia caused by the occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) arteryâ€”this acute reduction of blood supply to the myocardium results in necrosis of the heart muscle.

The thrombus formed at the site of plaque rupture in anterior myocardial infarction (MI) typically exhibits a white appearance (platelet-rich) at the site of rupture while appearing red at the margins (composed of red blood cells and fibrin). Thrombus formation involves a complex interplay of different cellular and non-cellular components within the blood. The breakdown of the extracellular matrix is a key factor in the exact cause of plaque rupture, with matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) playing a significant role.

MMPs contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix, leading to positive remodeling and core expansion, which contribute to plaque progression. The initial disruption of fibrillar collagen occurs through the action of MMPs, creating a vulnerability within the plaque. Additionally, apoptosis of smooth muscle cells and macrophages, as well as elastolysis, may also contribute to plaque rupture. These processes collectively contribute to the pathophysiology of plaque rupture and subsequent thrombus formation in conditions such as anterior myocardial infarction.[5]

**Plaque Erosion**

Plaque erosion is the second most common cause of acute coronary syndrome, differing from plaque rupture by the absence of fibrous cap disintegration or fissure. In plaque erosion, there is a lack of communication between the necrotic core and the luminal thrombus.

The thrombus appears white and contains abundant neutrophils, while smooth muscle cells are interspersed. The necrotic core is small, and there is a lack of endothelial lining due to apoptosis. This allows the blood components to encounter the collagen, leading to thrombus formation.

The site of plaque erosion is rich in proteoglycan and hyaluronan, in contrast to the site of plaque rupture, which has little. Optical coherence tomography can help differentiate between plaque erosion and rupture.[6]

**Microvascular and Coronary Spasm**

Spasm is a significant cause of acute coronary syndrome without thrombus formation. In these cases, the constriction of the microvessels or coronary arteries leads to inadequate blood supply to the myocardium, resulting in ischemia and subsequent symptoms of acute coronary syndrome.

This phenomenon, often called vasospastic angina or variant angina, can occur spontaneously or be triggered by various factors, such as stress, cold temperatures, or certain medications.

**AWMI Risk Factors**

  * Hypertension

  * Diabetes mellitus

  * Smoking

  * Dyslipidemia

  * Family history of premature coronary artery disease

  * Overweight or obesity

  * Age and gender

  * Inflammation

  * Diet - high glycemic index and low fiber, red meat, trans-fatty acid. 

  * Lack of exercise

## Epidemiology

The incidence of acute myocardial infarction demonstrates an age-dependent increase and exhibits variation with gender. Findings from the Framingham study revealed that over 10 years, the incidence of MI was 12.9 per 1,000 males (aged 30 to 34) and 5.2 per 1,000 females (aged 35 to 44). This increased by 8 to 9 times in people aged 55 to 64.[7] However, AMI's epidemiology has changed with advancements in diagnosis and management. A 2000 to 2014 study analyzed the annual change in percentages for AMI hospitalizations, including ST-elevation and non-ST elevation MI. The findings indicate a significant decline in AMI hospitalizations per 100,000 person-years across all ethnicities after adjusting for age and gender.[8]

Across the United States, a notable disparity exists in outcomes for AMI, with certain states experiencing poorer results. Lagging states exhibit higher incidence and prevalence rates of AMI, increased mortality associated with AMI, and lower life expectancy overall.[9] Compared with the developed world, South-Asian countries face a relatively higher burden of AMI and coronary artery disease (CAD).[10]

CAD remains a significant public health concern. According to 2013 data, cardiovascular disease, including CAD, accounts for approximately 1 in every 3 deaths in the United States.[11] For every hospitalized patient with MI, an estimated 30 patients have stable angina. Furthermore, the prevalence of CAD increases with age for both men and women.[12] While the prevalence of CAD has not decreased, the mortality rate from MI has declined. This encouraging trend can be attributed to advancements in treatment strategies and improved management of MI.

According to a study, it was found that the incidence of anterior ST-elevation MI (STEMI) accounts for approximately 33% of all STEMIs.[13] Additionally, the incidence of cardiogenic shock in AMI ranges from 5% to 15%.[14]

## Pathophysiology

Erosion or rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque in LAD leads to thrombus formation. Erosion of the plaque exposes thrombogenic lipid core or subendothelial tissue, leading to enhanced vascular inflammatory activity and thrombus formation.[15] The disruption of endothelial continuity facilitates the accumulation of thrombogenic blood components, forming a thrombus. The integrity of the fibrous cap is maintained through a delicate equilibrium between collagen synthesis and degradation.

Various cytokines, such as interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, macrophage chemoattractant proteins, and macrophage colony-stimulating factors, participate in the inflammatory response. The central region of the thrombus is predominantly composed of platelets, giving it a 'white' appearance. In contrast, the proximal and distal ends of the thrombus appear 'red' due to the accumulation of fibrin and red blood cells. A thrombus and vasospasm can reduce blood supply to the myocardium, leading to ischemia and subsequent myocardial infarction.

The consequences of acute myocardial infarction arise as a result of the following series of pathophysiological events: 

**Systolic dysfunction and cardiogenic shock** : Disruption in the blood supply along the LAD leads to compromised myocardium contractility. Consequently, several manifestations may occur, including dyssynchrony (uncoordinated contraction of different myocardial segments), hypokinesia (reduced endocardial thickening), akinesia (absent endocardial thickening), or dyskinesia (paradoxical endocardial motion and bulging of the endocardial layer).

The non-infarcted segments of the myocardium may exhibit compensatory hyperkinesia, which usually resolves in 2 weeks following the ischemic insult. Ischemia in remote areas of the heart can arise from the loss of collateral circulation originating from the occluded artery or a previous occlusion.

This systolic dysfunction causes a decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and blood pressure. The rate of pressure change (dP/dt) also drops, leading to an increase in end-systolic ventricular volume. Conversely, a drop in end-systolic volume is one of the most significant predictors of outcomes in acute myocardial infarction.

Ventricular dyskinesia creates a mechanical disadvantage, contributing to decreased stroke volume. The elongation and dilation of ischemic segments further promote the expansion of the infarct.[16] A noticeable decline in ejection fraction is observed when more than 15% of the myocardium is compromised. Clinical indications of heart failure and cardiogenic shock typically become evident after losing 40% of the myocardium.

As ejection fraction decreases, left ventricular end-diastolic pressures increase, and dP/dt decreases. The rate of change in ventricular pressure during isovolumetric contraction, known as dP/dt, represents ventricular contractile function. A value below 1,000 mmHg/sec is considered abnormal. 

**Diastolic dysfunction:** Characterized by elevated left ventricular filling pressures and altered dP/dt. In ischemia, ventricular relaxation is slowed, increasing filling pressures within the left ventricle.[17]

**Circulatory regulation** : Reduced stroke volume and cardiac output result in reduced coronary perfusion pressure, worsening ischemia. This cycle may lead to cardiogenic shock.

Myocardial infarction also initiates a systemic inflammatory response in the body. The release of inflammatory cytokines contributes to hypotension by causing vasodilation and reduced systemic vascular resistance. In addition, the depressed left ventricular function increases left ventricular volume, leading to elevated wall tension and increased afterload. This further decreases stroke volume, exacerbating ischemia.

Hyperkinesia of non-infarcted segments serves as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate the reduction in stroke volume. The increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) causes pulmonary congestion and hypoxemia, contributing to ischemia. 

## Histopathology

The gross pathological, histochemical, light microscopic, and ultrastructural findings vary with coronary occlusion and ischemia onset.

  * Gross alterations become evident after 6 to 12 hours. Gross pathology reveals evidence of transmural infarction or myocardial necrosis in most cases of occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). However, within hours of infarction, histo-chemically, the necrotic area appears pale with triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, indicating a lack of staining, whereas the uninfarcted area appears brick red.[18]

  * The primary sequence of events in myocardial infarction involves hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis, followed by contraction band necrosis, and eventually, delayed inflammation and repair. 

  * Temporally, a sequential series of changes can be observed in myocardial infarction, beginning with the waviness of myocardial fibers, coagulation necrosis, myocardial edema, focal hemorrhage, and neutrophilic infiltration. This is followed by ongoing coagulation necrosis and pallor due to shrunken cells and contraction band necrosis. Subsequently, there is loss of striation (around 8 hours) and further necrosis with continued neutrophilic infiltration. This cascade of events leads to the disintegration of myocardial fibers and subsequent phagocytosis, resulting in a soft yellow-brown core surrounded by a hyperemic border. After complete phagocytosis, granulation tissue formation occurs along with neo-vascularization and a fibrous reaction (around 14 days), ultimately forming an organized fibrous scar (approximately 3 months). 

  * Electron microscopy reveals early signs of myocardial damage, such as depletion of glycogen granules and swelling of mitochondrial and sarcolemma, which can be observed as early as 20 minutes after the onset of ischemia. This is followed by further mitochondrial disruption, formation of amorphous aggregates, and relaxation of myofibrils, typically occurring around 60 minutes. Finally, irreversible structural damage to myocardial cells begins manifesting within 20 minutes to 2 hours of the ischemic insult.
