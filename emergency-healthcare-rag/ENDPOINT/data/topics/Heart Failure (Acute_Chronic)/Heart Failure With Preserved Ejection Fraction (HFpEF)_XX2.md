## Treatment / Management

**Therapeutic Interventions in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction**

The goals of therapy for HFpEF are to reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, prevent disease progression, reduce hospitalizations, and effectively manage underlying comorbidities. To this end, lifestyle and behavioral modifications are a cornerstone of therapeutic intervention.

**Lifestyle interventions**

Several studies have demonstrated that exercise training improves cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[71] Exercise training, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, and weight loss improve functional status, exercise performance, rates of heart failure-specific hospitalization, and quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[72] Caloric restriction and exercise training may have positive additive effects in patients with HFpEF, especially if they are older with concomitant obesity.[73] In addition to caloric restriction, at least 1 study has demonstrated that sodium restriction as part of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet improves ventricular diastolic function and arterial elastance in patients with HFpEF and hypertension.[74]

**Antihypertensive therapies**

Diuretics, angiotensin receptorâ€“neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs) are the preferred pharmacologic interventions if blood pressure is uncontrolled in a patient with HFpEF. The currently recommended blood pressure goal is below 130/80 mm Hg.[12] The nonrandomized Optimize-HF (Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients with Heart Failure) registry demonstrated improved 30-day mortality and decreased hospitalization for heart failure with diuretic use compared to no diuretic therapy after hospital discharge for heart failure.[75] Bumetanide and torsemide have better bioavailability than furosemide. Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics. Diuretic resistance is a common problem and may be due to excessive dietary sodium consumption, using medications that negatively affect diuretic action, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or underlying chronic kidney disease.

A meta-analysis of 11 trials of 14,262 patients in sinus rhythm, including 244 patients with HFpEF, demonstrated that beta blockers reduce mortality and have beneficial effects.[76] Patients with HFpEF and concomitant coronary artery disease also benefit from beta-blocker administration. The Treatment of Preserved Cardiac Function Heart Failure with an Aldosterone Antagonist (TOPCAT) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial of 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and an LVEF of greater than 45% that demonstrated some reduction in hospitalization rates for heart failure.[77] This was particularly true for patients with an LVEF of less than 55% to 60% and those with elevated BNP.[78]

A prespecified subgroup analysis of patients in the Prospective Comparison of ARNI with ARB Global Outcomes in HFpEF (PARAGON-HF) demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan, as compared with valsartan, has a tendency to lower the risk of heart failure-related hospitalizations overall, but more so in women with HFpEF than men; the average LVEF in study participants was 57%.[79]

**Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor therapy**

The effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy on cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF has been demonstrated in the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patients with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) and Empagliflozin in Heart Failure with a Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-PRESERVED) trials.[80] The DELIVER trial demonstrated that dapagliflozin decreased the risk of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death among patients with HFpEF.[81] The EMPEROR-PRESERVED trial demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart failure-related hospitalizations, decline in kidney function, and improved quality of life in patients with HFpEF.[82] The effects of SGLTi therapy are consistent for patients with HFpEF across all age groups, and increasing age has not been associated with an increase in adverse events.[16][83] SGLT2i therapy should be considered in all patients with HFpEF, with or without underlying type 2 diabetes, as early as index hospitalization after initial medical stabilization.[81]

In patients with HFpEF, obesity, and underlying type 2 diabetes, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogs or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor antagonists are beneficial if dual therapy is required.[12]

**Rate control in atrial fibrillation**

Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are the preferred therapies for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation and HFpEF. Digoxin may be considered in hypotensive patients. Atrial fibrillation in patients with HFpEF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, rheumatic mitral valve stenosis, or a mechanical mitral valve requires anticoagulation regardless of CHA2DS2-VASc score. The 2023 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation recommends catheter ablation as a first-line therapy to improve symptoms of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in younger patients with fewer comorbidities.[84]

**Additional therapies**

In patients with HFpEF and suspected sleep apnea, consultation with sleep medicine for possible polysomnography is recommended. Fatigue is a common symptom of heart failure, and daytime sleepiness is a common symptom of sleep apnea; obesity is a risk factor for both disease processes.[1]

Using CardioMEMS, a pulmonary artery pressure hemodynamic monitoring system, improves quality of life and decreases hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF and frequent hospitalizations.[85] Additionally, CardioMEMS utilization has been shown to improve underlying metabolic comorbidities in tandem with improving pulmonary artery pressures.[85]

Coronary angiogram and revascularization should be considered if ischemia is driving symptoms of HFpEF.[86]

The 2022 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure recommends that all patients with a diagnosis of heart failure receive palliative and supportive care.[1] In the context of patients with HFpEF, palliative care is defined as "patient- and family-centered care that optimizes health-related quality of life by anticipating, preventing, and treating suffering."[1] Primary palliative care should begin early in the course of illness, and the interdisciplinary team can address many primary needs.[87] Components of primary palliative care include high-quality communication, anticipatory guidance, advance care planning, home and case management assistance, care coordination, and addressing barriers to care such as food insecurity and transportation needs.[1][87][88]

**Acute Decompensation of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction**

Multidisciplinary shock team assessment and intervention can improve 30-day all-cause mortality and reduce in-hospital mortality in patients with clinical and hemodynamics-proven cardiogenic shock of any etiology.[89] Intravenous vasopressor support can temporarily improve hemodynamics in patients with cardiogenic shock and improve end-organ perfusion; norepinephrine is preferred except in patients with tachyarrhythmias who benefit from phenylephrine. Vasopressor support allows time for diuresis and correction of precipitating factors like arrhythmia and ischemia.

Appropriate ventilatory support and diuresis are the cornerstones of therapy for patients with acutely decompensated HFpEF. In most cases, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazide diuretics; there is no scientific evidence to support one loop diuretic over another in acutely decompensated patients with HFpEF. The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) trial revealed no clinically significant differences in symptomatic improvement between bolus or continuous intravenous loop diuretics.[90] Some patients may require a combination of diuretic classes, such as thiazide, thiazide-like, or acetazolamide. Adding metolazone increases the risk of hypokalemia, hyponatremia, worsening renal function, and mortality compared to loop diuretics alone.[91] Contrarily, the Acetazolamide in Decompensated Heart Failure with Volume OveRload (ADVOR) trial demonstrated that adding acetazolamide to loop diuretics increases the incidence of successful decongestion in patients with acute heart failure within three days compared to placebo.[92]

Following the initial stabilization of hemodynamics and ventilation, assessing and managing ischemia, arrhythmia, and other precipitating factors and comorbidities is paramount. Urgent revascularization is preferred in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. Intravenous or topical nitroglycerin is preferred in patients with hypertensive urgency or emergency and pulmonary edema; nitroglycerin decreases preload in patients with pulmonary edema.

Short-term renal replacement therapy or ultrafiltration should be considered in symptomatic hypervolemic patients with poor renal function and minimal urine output, irrespective of supportive therapy and stable hemodynamics. Patients with poor baseline renal function or end-stage renal disease are at a significantly increased risk for requiring renal replacement therapy.

There is no substantial evidence supporting the early initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, MRAs, SGLT2i therapy, or beta blockers to prevent major adverse cardiac events in unstable patients with acutely decompensated HFpEF. Thiazolidinediones and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors such as sitagliptin or saxagliptin are contraindicated in acutely decompensated HFpEF.

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of exertional dyspnea with or without generalized fatigue is extensive and includes cardiac and noncardiac etiologies. Additionally, because the clinical syndrome of heart failure is the common endpoint for many disease processes, the overarching differential diagnosis for heart failure is similarly broad. However, in patients with exertional dyspnea and an underlying risk factor for HFpEF or comorbidity strongly associated with the development of HFpEF, the following diagnoses should be considered:[7][16]

  * Coronary artery disease

  * Hypertension

  * Valvular disease, particularly left-sided valvular disease

  * Infiltrative cardiac diseases such as amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and sarcoidosis

  * Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

  * Constrictive pericarditis.

## Prognosis

Patients with HFpEF have increased rates of morbidity and mortality compared with patients without heart failure. However, recent studies suggest that morbidity rates are similar for patients with HFpEF and HFrEF.[27][93] The presence and severity of common comorbidities such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease significantly influence the prognosis of patients with HFpEF.[27][94][27] Biomarkers like BNP, NT-pro BNP, and high-sensitivity troponin are associated with prognosis in HFpEF; elevated biomarker levels may indicate increased cardiovascular risk.

Independent predictors of mortality in patients with HFpEF confer a poor prognosis.[10][52][36][53][94] These predictors include but are not limited to:

  * Older age

  * Male sex

  * NYHA class C or D

  * Lower LVEF and the degree of diastolic dysfunction

  * Extent of coronary artery disease

  * Peripheral artery disease

  * Diabetes

  * Functional renal impairment

  * Pulmonary hypertension

  * Right ventricular dysfunction

  * Atrial fibrillation

  * Increased red cell distribution width.

## Complications

Complications stemming from HFpEF are multifaceted, reflecting the intricate interplay of diverse risk factors, complex pathophysiological processes, and the heterogeneous nature of this clinical syndrome. Left atrial dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension often develop, placing an increased workload on the right ventricle and increasing the risk of biventricular failure. 

Beyond cardiovascular implications, HFpEF introduces complications associated with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Impaired exercise tolerance and functional decline are common, as diminished physiologic reserve manifests in more severe dyspnea and fatigue, impacting daily activities.

Diagnostic challenges and overlapping symptoms make timely identification complex, potentially delaying appropriate interventions. Therapeutic challenges arise from the varied responses to interventions among HFpEF patients, necessitating a personalized, multidisciplinary approach to manage these complications effectively. Ongoing research endeavors aim to deepen our understanding and refine strategies for addressing the intricate complications associated with HFpEF, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.

## Consultations

Patients with HFpEF typically present to a primary care provider with complaints of exertional dyspnea, activity intolerance, and fatigue. However, the diagnosis of HFpEF may require the expertise of a cardiologist. Once a diagnosis of HFpEF is made, patients require consultation with the cardiac rehabilitation team, cardiac nursing, and a cardiac dietitian. Underlying comorbidities may necessitate consultation with interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, pulmonology-sleep medicine, endocrinology, or a heart failure specialist. While the primary care team can meet most primary palliative care needs, consultation with social workers, case management, or palliative care specialists may become necessary to identify barriers to adequate care and provide patient- and family-specific support. Evidence supports improved quality of life and decreased hospitalizations in patients with heart failure who receive care at a high-volume heart failure center.[95]

## Deterrence and Patient Education

All patients with HFpEF should receive counseling and education that emphasizes compliance with dietary and medical therapies; dietary and medical noncompliance are the most common causes of hospital readmission in patients with heart failure.[96] Additionally, improvement in healthcare literacy is associated with a decreased need for emergency care due to heart failure exacerbations.[96] Although single-session educational interventions offer the same benefits as multisession interventions for most patients with heart failure, patients with lower levels of healthcare literacy may benefit from multisession interventions.[97]

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

The management of HFpEF requires a collaborative effort among healthcare professionals, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, pharmacists, and others, to enhance patient-centered care, improve outcomes, ensure patient safety, and optimize team performance. Given that heart failure represents a common endpoint for various disease processes, including ischemic heart disease secondary to coronary artery disease, addressing the underlying etiologies and risk factors is crucial.

HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome with predisposing conditions that involve increasing age, female sex, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Additionally, HFpEF may result from multiple risk factors, including sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, iron deficiency, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dysrhythmias. The complexity of HFpEF necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, and the exact pathogenic role of each risk factor remains incompletely understood.

Diagnosing HFpEF is challenging due to common clinical manifestations and the overlap with other heart failure subtypes. Diagnostic algorithms, such as HFA-PEFF and H2FPEF, along with additional testing like echocardiography and natriuretic peptide measurement, are employed to confirm the diagnosis. The 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure provides an evidence-based diagnostic approach.

Therapeutic interventions for HFpEF focus on reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, preventing disease progression, and managing comorbidities. Lifestyle modifications, including exercise training, weight loss, and sodium restriction, are cornerstones of treatment. Antihypertensive therapies, including diuretics, ARNIs, ARBs, and MRAs, are recommended, with a blood pressure goal lower than 130/80 mm Hg. Beta-blockers, sacubitril-valsartan, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are shown to have beneficial effects. Consultation with sleep medicine is recommended in patients with HFpEF and suspected sleep apnea.

For acute decompensation of HFpEF, a multidisciplinary shock team assessment involving intravenous vasopressors, appropriate ventilation support, and diuresis is crucial. Renal replacement therapy may be considered in patients with poor renal function. However, the early initiation of certain medications, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ARNIs, MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and beta-blockers, lacks substantial evidence for preventing major adverse cardiac events in unstable acute decompensated HFpEF.

The 2022 ACC/AHA Guideline emphasizes palliative and supportive care for all patients with heart failure, including those with HFpEF. Primary palliative care should begin early and address high-quality communication, advance care planning, home and case management assistance, and other needs. The complexity of HFpEF necessitates ongoing research and a comprehensive, team-based approach to optimize patient outcomes.
