## Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnoses for HF include:

  * Valvular heart diseases

  * Renal failure

  * Acute respiratory distress

  * Pulmonary fibrosis

  * Nephrotic syndrome

  * Pulmonary embolism

  * Pericardial diseases

  * Cirrhosis

## Staging

The ACC/AHA stages of HF are as follows: 

  * **Stage A** : At risk for HF. No current or past symptoms, structural heart disease, or evidence of elevated cardiac biomarkers, but risk factors are present. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiotoxic medications, or having a genetic variant for cardiomyopathy. 

  * **Stage B** : Pre-HF. Patients have no signs or symptoms of HF but have risk factors and structural heart disease, evidence of elevated filling pressures (by invasive or noninvasive assessment), or persistently elevated cardiomarkers in the absence of other reasons for elevated markers, like chronic kidney disease or myocarditis. 

  * **Stage C** : Symptomatic HF. Patients with current or past history of HF symptoms. 

  * **Stage D** : Advanced HF. Patients with refractory symptoms that interfere with daily life or recurrent hospitalization despite targeted guideline-directed medical therapy.

## Prognosis

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in December 2015, the rate of HF-related deaths decreased from 103.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 to 89.5 in 2009 but subsequently increased to 96.9 in 2014. The report noted that the trend correlates with a shift from coronary heart disease as the underlying cause of HF deaths to metabolic diseases and other noncardiac causes of HF, including obesity, diabetes, malignancies, chronic pulmonary diseases, and renal disease. The mortality rate following hospitalization for HF is estimated at around 10% at 30 days, 22% at 1 year, and 42% at 5 years. This can increase to >50% for patients with stage D HF.[48]

**Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score**

The Ottawa Heart Failure Risk Score is a useful tool for determining prognosis in patients presenting to the emergency department with HF.[49] This score is used to determine the 14-day mortality risk, hospital readmission, and acute coronary syndrome to help arrive at safe disposition planning. Patients with a score of 0 are considered low risk. A score of 1 to 2 is considered moderate risk, a score of 3 to 4 is considered high risk, and a score of 5 or higher is considered very high risk.

Each of the following criteria is given 1 point if present:

  * History of stroke or transient ischemic attack

  * Oxygen saturation <90%

  * Heart rate >110 bpm on the 3-minute walk test

  * Acute ischemic ECG changes 

  * An NT-ProBNP level of >5000 ng/L

Each of the following criteria is given 2 points if present: 

  * Prior history of mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress

  * Heart rate >110 bpm on presentation

  * Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >33.6 mg/dL (12 mmol/L)

  * Serum bicarbonate level >35 mg/d

## Complications

Complications of HF include:

  * Reduced quality of life

  * Arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death

  * Cardiac cachexia

  * Cardiorenal disease

  * Liver dysfunction

  * Functional valvular insufficiencies (eg, functional MR or TR)

  * Mural thrombi and risk of thromboembolism (brain, kidney, lung, major limb vessels)

  * Recurrent hospitalizations and nosocomial infection

  * Mortality

## Consultations

The consultation type depends on the disease stage and the intended management strategy. Commonly consulted specialists include:

  * Heart failure specialist

  * Interventional cardiologist (to address structural heart disease percutaneously)

  * Cardiac electrophysiologist (device therapy)

  * Cardiac surgeon (for CABG, VHD, or mechanical cardiac support)

  * Cardiac imaging specialist

  * Cardiac transplant specialist for stage D patients

  * Cardiac rehabilitation physiotherapist

  * Dietician

  * Palliative care (if aligned with the goal of care)

## Deterrence and Patient Education

Risk factor reduction and aggressive management of comorbid conditions are crucial to reducing morbidity and mortality associated with HF. In addition to compliance with medications, patients need guidance on self-monitoring of symptoms of HF and avoiding the triggers of HF. These strategies can help prevent the development of HF in patients at high risk for the disease and slow the progression in those who are already diagnosed with it. Patient education is necessary to facilitate self-care and compliance. Close supervision, including surveillance by the patient and family, home-based visits, telephone support, and remote monitoring, is recommended. Socioeconomic support is pivotal in the appropriate management of the disease.[1] Patients require close clinical follow-up to assess volume status, effects of drug therapy, and escalation of care as indicated. 

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

HF is a complex clinical syndrome with high morbidity and mortality, necessitating an interprofessional approach to optimize patient-centered care and outcomes. Physicians, including clinical cardiologists, interventionalists, electrophysiologists, HF specialists, and cardiac imaging specialists, collaborate to diagnose, manage, and treat HF using evidence-based medical and procedural interventions. Advanced practitioners, such as HF nurse practitioners, play a crucial role in ongoing patient assessment, medication titration, and patient education to improve adherence to guideline-directed therapy. Specialty-trained HF nurses are vital in educating patients on lifestyle modifications, symptom recognition, and weight management to prevent exacerbations and reduce hospital admissions. Physical therapists help improve functional capacity and promote safe activity levels, while HF-trained social workers and case managers assess patients in community settings or through home visits to facilitate adherence to care plans and address social determinants of health that may impact disease management.

Effective interprofessional communication and care coordination are essential to enhancing patient safety, team performance, and long-term outcomes in HF management. Structured communication strategies, such as interdisciplinary rounds and shared electronic health records, ensure seamless information exchange among clinicians. Clinical pharmacists work closely with physicians and nurses to review patient medication lists, optimize pharmacologic therapy, and prevent adverse drug-drug interactions, thereby improving medication safety. Collaboration between primary care clinicians and cardiologists helps ensure continuity of care, minimize adverse effects of medical therapy, and slow disease progression. A well-coordinated, team-based approach significantly improves the quality of life for HF patients by integrating medical, pharmacologic, and lifestyle interventions while reducing hospitalizations and mortality.
