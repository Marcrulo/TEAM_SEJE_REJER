## Continuing Education Activity

Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively due to structural or functional impairments. The most common cause of HF is ischemic heart disease, but other factors, such as hypertension, valvular disease, and myocarditis, also contribute to its development.

HF is classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and clinical staging. Common symptoms of HF include shortness of breath, fatigue, fluid retention, and edema. This course explores the complexities surrounding HF's extensive etiologies, assessment, classification, and staging. This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance the learner's competence in identifying HF, performing the recommended multifaceted evaluation, and implementing an appropriate interprofessional approach when managing this condition, which is essential to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

**Objectives:**

  * Evaluate clinical presentation and apply the staging and classification systems of heart failure.

  * Assess the etiology of heart failure using clinical assessment and appropriate diagnostic tests. 

  * Develop a management plan for patients with heart failure based on their clinical stage and investigations.

  * Collaborate with interprofessional healthcare teams, including cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists, and pharmacists, to ensure coordinated and comprehensive care for heart failure patients.

## Introduction

Heart failure (HF), as defined by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), is a complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood. HF is a common disorder worldwide with a high morbidity and mortality rate. With an estimated prevalence of 26 million people worldwide, CHF contributes to increased healthcare costs, reduces functional capacity, and significantly affects quality of life. Accurately diagnosing and effectively treating the disease is essential to prevent recurrent hospitalizations, decrease morbidity and mortality, and enhance patient outcomes.[1]

The etiology of HF is variable and extensive. Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of HF. The general management of HF aims to relieve systemic and pulmonary congestion and stabilize hemodynamic status, regardless of the cause. The treatment of HF requires a multifaceted approach involving patient education, optimal medication administration, and decreasing acute exacerbations. Per the recent ACC/AHA guidelines for HF 2022, patients with HF are classified based on left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas clinical and laboratory parameters are integrated to stage patients. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification stratifies and defines the functional capacity and severity of HF symptoms. This system is subjectively determined by clinicians and is widely used in clinical practice to direct therapy. Management of patients depends on the classification and staging of the disease.[1]

The following parameters are used to classify HF based on LVEF:

  * **HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** : LV EF ≤40% 

  * **HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction** : LVEF 41% to 49% and evidence of HF (spontaneous or provokable elevated cardiac biomarkers or elevated filling pressures)

  * **HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)** : LVEF ≥50% and evidence of HF (spontaneous or provokable elevated cardiac biomarkers or elevated filling pressures) 

  * **HF with improved ejection fraction** : LV EF >40%, with previously documented LV EF ≤40% [1]

The ACC/AHA Stages of HF are as follows: 

  * Stage A: At risk for HF. No current or past symptoms, structural heart disease, or evidence of elevated cardiac biomarkers, but risk factors are present. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cardiotoxic medications, or having a genetic variant for cardiomyopathy. 

  * Stage B: Pre-HF. Patients have no signs or symptoms of HF but have risk factors and structural heart disease, evidence of elevated filling pressures (by invasive or noninvasive assessment), or persistently elevated cardiomarkers in the absence of other reasons for elevated markers, like chronic kidney disease or myocarditis. 

  * Stage C: Symptomatic HF. Patients with current or past history of HF symptoms. 

  * Stage D: Advanced HF. Patients with refractory symptoms that interfere with daily life or recurrent hospitalization despite targeted guideline-directed medical therapy.

For stage C and stage D HF patients, the following NYHA classification of HF symptoms should be used:

  * **Class I** : Symptom onset with more than ordinary level of activity

  * **Class II** : Symptom onset with an ordinary level of activity

  * **Class III** : Symptom onset with minimal activity

  *     * Class III a: No dyspnea at rest

    * Class III b: Recent onset of dyspnea at rest

  * **Class IV** : Symptoms at rest [2]

## Etiology

**Heart Failure Etiologies**

The etiologies of HF are extensive, though coronary artery disease (CAD) causing ischemic heart disease is the most common cause. Every attempt should be made to identify causative factors to help guide treatment strategies. The etiologies can be broadly classified as intrinsic heart disease and pathologies that are infiltrative, congenital, valvular, myocarditis-related, high-output failure, and secondary to systemic disease.[3][4] These classifications have significant overlap.

The 4 most common etiologies responsible for about two-thirds of HF cases are ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertensive heart disease, and rheumatic heart disease. Higher-income countries have higher rates of ischemic heart disease and COPD; lower-income countries have higher rates of hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy, rheumatic heart disease, and myocarditis.

**Ischemic heart disease**

Ischemic heart disease is by far the most common cause of HF worldwide. Ischemia leads to a lack of blood flow to heart muscles, reducing the EF. Incidence is increasing in developing countries as they adopt a more Western diet and lifestyle, and improved medical care decreases the infectious burden in these countries (myocarditis is often infection-related.)

**Valvular heart disease**

Valvular heart disease is another common intrinsic heart condition that can cause HF. Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of valvular heart disease in children and young adults worldwide. It is caused by an immune response to group A Streptococcus and primarily causes mitral and aortic stenosis.[5] Age-related degeneration is the most common overall cause of valvular disease, and the aortic valve is the most commonly affected. Women are more likely to experience mitral valve rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolapse, while men are more likely to suffer from aortic valve diseases such as regurgitation or stenosis. Endocarditis is also more common in men. 

**Hypertension**

Hypertension causes HF even in the absence of CAD or ischemic heart disease. High blood pressure causes mechanical stress by increased afterload and neurohormonal changes that increase ventricular mass.[3] Hypertension is also strongly associated with other comorbidities for HF development, and aggressively treating hypertension is shown to lower the incidence of HF.[3]

**Cardiomyopathy**

Cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by enlarged ventricles with impaired function not related to secondary causes such as ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, or congenital heart disease. The most common types of cardiomyopathies are hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, and left ventricular noncompaction.[6] In addition to CHF, cardiomyopathy can present as arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death, further compelling the identification of underlying disorders.

Many of these conditions have a genetic basis, and a detailed family history of sudden cardiac death, especially in first-degree relatives older than 35 years, should be taken. Over 50 identified genes contribute to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy alone. Genetic determinants have variable phenotypic expression, and many nongenetic factors also affect the clinical symptoms. Some of these factors include diabetes, toxic exposure, or pregnancy. Fabry disease is a rare glycogen storage disease that can cause CHF symptoms through a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pattern.[3][6]

**Inflammatory cardiomyopathy**

Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis along with ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. The most common cause is viral infection. Other etiologies are bacterial, fungal, or protozoal infections; toxic substances or drugs; and immune-mediated diseases. Chagas disease is caused by  _Trypanosoma cruzi,_ which is endemic in Latin America __ and commonly causes myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and CHF. Other viral causes of myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy include adenoviruses, enteroviruses, herpes virus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus. Viruses can also activate autoimmune myocarditis, including HIV, hepatitis C virus, influenzas A and B, and coronaviruses (including COVID-19). When associated with CHF, these conditions tend to have a poor prognosis.[7]

**Infiltrative cardiomyopathies**

Infiltrative cardiomyopathies cause a restrictive cardiomyopathy pattern (similar to the genetically determined restrictive cardiomyopathy variant), which is notable for normal ventricular systolic function but with diastolic dysfunction and restrictive left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) filling dynamics. This is often associated with a high E/A ratio showing increased early filling and delayed late filling.[6][8]

Cardiac amyloidosis results from misfolded protein deposits in the heart; this leads to cardiomyocyte separation, cellular toxicity, and tissue stiffness. Patients are preload dependent and are prone to symptomatic hypotension. Currently, tamifidis is the only medication known to prevent cardiac amyloidosis. It prevents, but does not reverse, amyloid deposition. Its high cost is also a limiting factor.[1][9]

Sarcoidosis is an acquired cardiomyopathy characterized by conduction defects and arrhythmias caused by the formation of granulomas. The most common cardiac manifestation is CHF. Due to the associated conduction abnormalities, beta-blockers must be used with caution.

Cardiac hemochromatosis is present in 15% to 20% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. This condition initially presents with a restrictive pattern but develops into biventricular systolic dysfunction.[8] Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy physiology can develop hypotension when treated with traditional CHF medications due to preload dependence, so caution should be used to avoid systemic hypoperfusion.[10]

**Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy**

Takotsubo or stress-induced cardiomyopathy (colloquially broken-heart syndrome) is an underrecognized cause of HF, which causes transient left-ventricular wall abnormalities that are not localized to a specific vascular territory. It has several proposed pathophysiologic mechanisms, including coronary vasospasm, microcirculatory dysfunction, and increased sympathetic nervous system activation. This condition is treated with medications typical for HF with the addition of antithrombotic medications in certain clinical situations with wall motion abnormalities. Recognized cases increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic.[11][12][13]

**Peripartum cardiomyopathy**

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of maternal mortality. During pregnancy, cardiac output is increased by 20% to 30% due to increased heart rate and stroke volume. It presents with CHF due to LV systolic dysfunction during late pregnancy, postpartum, or up to several months after delivery. There is likely an underlying genetic component, and it is more common in women with advanced maternal age, Black race, and multifetal pregnancies. If wall motion abnormalities are present, anticoagulation is essential due to the hypercoagulable state caused by pregnancy. Recovery is variable by global region and inversely correlates with lowered EF.[14]

**Obesity**

Obesity**** is a leading cause of CHF in patients younger than 40 years, according to the "Candesartan in Heart Failure Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity" (the CHARM study). The "obesity paradox" described elsewhere has significant study flaws and is derived from older data. Up to 10% of CHF cases are thought to be attributable to obesity alone. Patients with obesity are more likely to have HFpEF, possibly secondary to adipose-produced cytokines, eg, IL-1b, IL-8, and TNFα. Adipose tissue also degrades natriuretic peptides.[15][16][17]

**Tachycardia and arrhythmia**

Tachycardia and arrhythmia can induce a low-output CHF state. Dilation of all cardiac chambers and preservation or thinning of biventricular wall thickness is usually noted. Electrophysiologic changes accompany this, including prolonged duration and decreased amplitude of action potentials in the myocytes. All of these factors induce the typical neurohormonal response causing CHF. With rate control, these changes are often reversible due to myocardial hibernation.[18]

**Thyrotoxicosis**

Thyrotoxicosis is a rare cause of HF despite initiating a hyperdynamic circulatory state. This may be partially due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, causing sodium and water retention, as well as upregulation of erythropoietin-stimulating agent, both of which will cause increased blood volume. Sustained tachycardia with or without atrial fibrillation can also cause CHF.[19]

**High-output cardiac failure**

High-output cardiac failure can be associated with thiamine deficiency, which is a rare condition found primarily among patients who are elderly, homeless, or have alcohol abuse disorder. Thiamine deficiency causes decreased ATP production with an accumulation of adenosine, which causes systemic vasodilation. This leads to lowered systemic vascular resistance and increased cardiac output. This evolves to weakened myocardium and decreased EF. Diuretic use can also cause urinary thiamine loss, further compounding the situation.[20][21]

Other common causes of high-output cardiac failure are obesity, liver disease, and arteriovenous shunts. The causative physiologic changes are decreased afterload (ie, systemic vascular resistance) and increased metabolism. These can often present with preserved EF, pulmonary congestion, increased filling pressures, and elevated natriuretic peptides.[22][23]
