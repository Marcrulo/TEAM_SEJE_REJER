## Continuing Education Activity

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency resulting from mechanical or functional disruption of intestinal transit. This condition is most frequently caused by postoperative adhesions, followed by hernias, tumors, or less common conditions like volvulus, gallstone ileus, or endometriosis. SBO presents with hallmark symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, and obstipation. The pathophysiology includes bowel distension, impaired venous return, mucosal ischemia, bacterial translocation, and, in severe cases, necrosis, perforation, and peritonitis. Diagnosis involves clinical assessment and imaging, with computed tomography being the gold standard to identify the transition point, ischemia, or perforation. Initial management includes fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and nasogastric decompression, with surgery indicated for strangulation, ischemia, or unresolved obstruction.

Clinicians participating in this course gain a comprehensive understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of SBO. The course emphasizes the importance of early recognition of complications like ischemia and strangulation and highlights evidence-based protocols for nonoperative and surgical management. This recognition enhances clinician's diagnostic accuracy and decision-making skills, equipping them with the tools to improve patient outcomes in this complex and potentially life-threatening condition.

## Introduction

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common and potentially life-threatening surgical emergency that accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. This condition is characterized by the triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension, reflecting the disruption of normal intestinal flow. SBO can be broadly categorized into simple obstructions, which involve mechanical blockage without ischemia, and strangulated obstructions, which are associated with compromised blood flow, bowel ischemia, and potential necrosis. Prompt diagnosis and management are critical to prevent severe complications, including gangrenous bowel and perforation.

The most common cause of SBO is postoperative adhesions, followed by hernias, while other etiologies include malignancies, inflammatory strictures, and congenital anomalies. Initial management includes fluid and electrolyte resuscitation, nasogastric tube decompression, and early identification of strangulation.[1] Imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), is pivotal in confirming the diagnosis and guiding treatment. Nonoperative management is often effective for partial obstructions, while surgical intervention, such as adhesiolysis or bowel resection, is required in cases of complete obstruction, ischemia, or perforation.[2] This activity examines the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic workup, and management strategies for SBO, emphasizing evidence-based practices and recent advances in care.

## Etiology

The etiology of SBO encompasses a broad spectrum of mechanical and functional causes, each impacting management strategies and timing of surgical intervention. Mechanical SBO results from a physical barrier to the passage of bowel contents and can be classified based on the location of the obstruction: intraluminal, such as gallstone ileus; intramural, such as malignant lesions; and extrinsic, such as adhesions. In contrast, functional obstruction, termed ileus or paralytic ileus, arises from impaired peristalsis or metabolic disorders rather than a physical barrier.

**Adhesions**

Postoperative adhesions are the leading cause of SBO in developed countries, accounting for up to 74% of cases, and are the second leading cause in developing nations.[3] They result from fibrotic scar tissue forming after surgeries, which occur in as many as 97% of common surgeries such as appendectomy, colectomy, and gynecological surgery.[4] Adhesions are also seen after laparoscopic surgeries, though less frequently than open procedures. SBO that is secondary to adhesions in an abdomen without prior surgery, ie, a “virgin abdomen,” is very rarely seen but may occur in conditions such as familial Mediterranean fever and recurrent serositis.[5] The rarity of these types of SBO can result in a delay in diagnosis with complications leading to sepsis and death, emphasizing the need for heightened clinical suspicion and timely imaging for diagnosis

**Hernias**

Abdominal wall hernias, external (eg, inguinal or umbilical) and internal, are the second most common cause of SBO in developed countries (globally the leading cause). These hernias account for approximately 2% to 10% of cases and often require surgical intervention to relieve obstruction and prevent complications such as strangulation or ischemia. Notably, in patients with a “virgin abdomen,” abdominal wall hernias are the most frequent cause of SBO.[3] Internal hernias account for less than 1% of intestinal obstruction cases.[6] They can be congenital or acquired, and SBOs caused by these hernias are managed operatively.[7]

**Malignancies and Tumors**

Malignancy is the third most common cause of SBO after intraabdominal adhesions and hernias.[8] Malignant bowel obstruction, resulting from primary or metastatic cancers, accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of cases.[9] The most common primary small bowel tumors that cause SBO are adenocarcinomas, carcinoid tumors, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Metastases to the small intestine are far more common than primary tumors. The small bowel is a frequent site of metastasis, particularly from tumors of the colon, pancreas, ovary, and melanoma. Other tumors involved in SBO are lymphoma, leiomyomas, and desmoid tumors. 

**Gallstone Ileus**

A rare cause, gallstone ileus, occurs when a gallstone enters the bowel through a biliary-enteric fistula, causing obstruction, typically at the ileocecal valve. Diagnosis is based on imaging findings, including the Rigler triad: mechanical obstruction, pneumobilia, and an ectopic gallstone within the bowel lumen.[10]

**Inflammatory and Infectious Conditions**

Crohn disease is a significant cause of SBO, with inflammation due to active disease accounting for 5% of all SBOs.[11] Up to 80% of patients with ileal disease require surgical intervention at some point in their lives.[12] In patients with small bowel Crohn disease, one of the primary surgical indications for small bowel resection is inflammatory SBO, followed by intestinal fistula and abscess. Although many patients develop disease recurrence at the anastomosis, some develop SBO without evidence of inflammation at the transition point.[13]

Endometriosis can also lead to acute SBO through inflammation or adhesions. Acute SBO secondary to intestinal endometriosis underscores the pivotal role of laparoscopic surgery in the evaluation of SBO.[14] Infectious processes, such as radiation enteritis, may cause delayed-onset obstruction due to fibrosis and ischemia. Approximately a third of patients with chronic radiation enteritis may ultimately require surgical intervention for indications such as obstruction.

**Motility Disorders**

SBO can also result from intestinal dysmotility (ie, impaired bowel movement without a physical blockage) that can be caused by functional gastrointestinal disorders like chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, where the intestines lack normal peristaltic activity, or by drug-induced motility issues, such as those caused by opioids or anticholinergics.[15] Additionally, enteric myopathies, either primary or secondary to conditions like muscular dystrophy, affect the smooth muscle of the small bowel, leading to motility dysfunction. Enteric neuropathy, caused by neurological or metabolic conditions (eg, diabetes or Parkinson disease), can also disrupt normal motility, presenting with symptoms similar to mechanical SBO. Proper diagnosis requires imaging and sometimes specialized tests to differentiate functional obstructions from mechanical causes, and treatment focuses on managing the underlying condition and supporting motility.

**Rare Causes**

Small bowel encapsulation is a rare cause of SBO. In this condition, the small intestine is encased by a fibrous membrane within the peritoneum, limiting its movement and potentially causing obstruction. This condition can present as acute or chronic SBO, often requiring imaging such as CT scans for diagnosis.[16] Encapsulation can result from congenital conditions or be secondary to inflammatory or infectious processes.

Small bowel volvulus is another uncommon cause, where the bowel twists around its mesentery, obstructing blood flow and causing ischemia. Volvulus can occur anywhere in the small bowel but is more common in the midgut; this leads to bowel distention, pain, and potentially ischemia or necrosis if not treated promptly. Volvulus may be associated with abnormal intestinal mobility or congenital malformations, like malrotation. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through radiographic imaging (ie, CT or contrast studies), and surgical intervention is often required to untwist the bowel and prevent ischemia.

**Pediatric**

Congenital or acquired adhesions are the most common causes of SBO. The second most common cause is intussusception. Other causes include congenital atresia, volvulus, ingestion of foreign bodies, and Meckel diverticulum.[17]

## Epidemiology

SBO is a common surgical emergency, contributing to 15% to 20% of hospital admissions for acute abdominal pain and accounting for approximately 80% of all bowel obstructions. Each year, over 300,000 laparotomies are performed in the United States for SBO. The incidence of SBO is closely associated with the prevalence of abdominal surgeries, as postoperative adhesions are the leading cause, responsible for more than 75% of cases.[18] The risk of SBO increases with the number of prior intraabdominal procedures, emphasizing the importance of surgical history in assessing patient risk.

SBO is observed across all age groups but is more common in older adults due to higher rates of abdominal surgeries, malignancies, and hernias. Sex differences in etiology are evident, with women more prone to adhesion-related SBO due to gynecological procedures, while men are more likely to experience hernia-related obstruction. In low-resource settings, hernias are a predominant cause due to limited access to elective hernia repair surgeries. SBO is less common in children and typically results from congenital abnormalities such as malrotation or intussusception.

Over the past 4 decades, advancements in imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy, and laparoscopic techniques have significantly altered the management of SBO. Before 1981, surgery was the definitive treatment. Since then, adopting nonoperative protocols has improved patient selection for timely surgical intervention, such as laparoscopic lysis of adhesions. Despite these advancements, recurrent SBO remains a concern, with a recurrence rate of 12% to 32% after initial surgical management.

Delayed diagnosis and intervention can lead to complications such as strangulation, bowel ischemia, and sepsis—conditions associated with a mortality rate exceeding 25%. While improved diagnostic modalities have enhanced outcomes in developed nations, delays in care and limited access to advanced surgical techniques remain significant challenges in resource-constrained settings. Understanding the epidemiology of SBO is critical for developing preventive measures, optimizing treatment protocols, and reducing the global burden of this condition.

## Pathophysiology

SBO results from an interruption in the normal flow of intestinal contents due to a mechanical blockage or functional impairment. This disruption triggers a series of pathological processes affecting the bowel wall, vascular supply, and systemic physiology. These processes can escalate rapidly, especially in cases of strangulation or ischemia, underscoring the critical need for timely diagnosis and intervention.

**Mechanical Obstruction**

In mechanical SBO, a physical barrier obstructs the bowel lumen, creating a transition point where proximal bowel distention and distal bowel decompression occur. The obstructing lesion prevents the passage of intestinal contents, leading to increased intraluminal pressure proximal to the obstruction. This pressure gradient causes:

  * Proximal bowel distention 
    * This may induce vomiting as the bowel attempts to relieve pressure.

  * Distal bowel decompression 
    * This occurs along with inhibition of peristalsis distal to the obstruction, while proximal peristalsis temporarily increases to overcome the blockage.

Common causes of mechanical obstruction include adhesions, hernias, tumors, strictures, and volvulus.

**Physiological Consequences**

  * Impaired venous flow and bowel wall edema 
    * As the proximal bowel distends, venous outflow from the bowel wall is compromised, resulting in bowel wall edema and inflammation. These changes can exacerbate luminal narrowing and impair the oxygenation of the bowel tissue.

  * Third spacing and fluid loss 
    * Increased bowel wall permeability leads to fluid and electrolyte sequestration into the bowel lumen and third spacing into the peritoneal cavity as ascitic fluid. This fluid loss, coupled with vomiting and decreased oral intake, contributes to dehydration, hypovolemia, and metabolic disturbances.

  * Bacterial translocation 
    * The thickened, inflamed, and ischemic bowel wall becomes more permeable, allowing bacteria, predominantly _Escherichia coli_ , to translocate into the bloodstream or peritoneal cavity. This can result in peritonitis, bacteremia, and systemic infection.

  * Ischemia and infarction 
    * Prolonged obstruction increases intraluminal pressure to a point where arterial blood flow is compromised. This results in ischemia, necrosis, and, if untreated, perforation. Perforation leads to peritonitis, which can progress to sepsis and death.[19]

  * Systemic effects 
    * The combination of fluid loss, bacterial translocation, and ischemia activates a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, increasing the risk of septic shock and multiorgan failure.

**Distinction Based on Obstruction Location**

  * Proximal SBO 
    * Characterized by significant vomiting, minimal abdominal distension, and rapid onset of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances

  * Distal SBO 
    * Associated with more pronounced abdominal distension, delayed vomiting, and slower progression of systemic complications

**Functional Obstruction**

In functional SBO, peristalsis fails due to metabolic disturbances, neural inhibition, or inflammation (paralytic ileus). While there is no mechanical barrier, the resulting pathophysiology is similar, with stasis leading to fluid sequestration, bowel distention, and bacterial overgrowth.

## Histopathology

The histopathological changes in SBO evolve in response to the obstruction's severity, duration, and underlying cause. The diagnosis can be confirmed with histology in a unit with expertise in this pathology area.[15] Early stages are marked by mucosal edema, hyperemia, and increased intraluminal pressure, impairing venous return and causing fluid accumulation in the mucosa and submucosa. This fluid results in villous edema and mild inflammatory cell infiltration, primarily by neutrophils and lymphocytes. Capillary dilation and vascular engorgement in the lamina propria lead to hyperemia and increased permeability. As the obstruction progresses, ischemia exacerbates tissue damage, causing mucosal ulceration and sloughing of the epithelial layer, compromising the mucosal barrier. Bowel wall inflammation intensifies with polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration, and bacterial translocation, particularly by _E coli_ , increases the risk of peritonitis or bacteremia.

Prolonged ischemia leads to necrosis, initially affecting the mucosa and extending to the muscularis propria and serosa. The bowel wall thickens with fibrin deposition and inflammation, and in severe cases, full-thickness necrosis appears as coagulative necrosis, where cellular details are lost and tissues exhibit hypereosinophilic staining. In cases of strangulated obstruction caused by herniation, volvulus, or adhesions, hemorrhagic necrosis and venous congestion are common—with the bowel wall darkened and thickened due to blood accumulation. Gangrenous changes, marked by liquefactive necrosis and mixed inflammatory infiltrates, may develop; the serosal surface may show fibrinopurulent exudates, indicating secondary peritonitis. Prolonged ischemia can also cause vascular thrombosis in mesenteric veins, worsening ischemia and infarction. Reperfusion after ischemia leads to oxidative stress and neutrophilic infiltration, contributing to cellular injury and inflammation.

Histological features vary depending on the etiology of SBO. For example, adhesions and bands typically show fibrosis and mesothelial hyperplasia at adhesion sites, while strangulated hernias display congestion, necrosis, and inflammation. Tumor-related obstructions reveal malignancy-specific features, such as glandular structures in adenocarcinoma or spindle cells in stromal tumors. Crohn disease presents with transmural inflammation, noncaseating granulomas, and fibrosis, whereas radiation enteritis shows vascular sclerosis, submucosal fibrosis, and ulceration.

Increased intraluminal pressure also leads to endothelial tissue remodeling, which alters the epithelial cell type to withstand the mechanical forces exerted by extraluminal factors such as tumors and adhesions.[20] Fibrous tissue thickening and adhesions can also replace simple columnar epithelial cells, obstructing gastrointestinal absorption and interfering with normal small intestine functions. Consequently, patients with SBO often present with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, obstipation, constipation, and abdominal distention.[21]
