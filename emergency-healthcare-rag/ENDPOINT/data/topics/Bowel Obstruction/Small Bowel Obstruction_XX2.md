## History and Physical

**History**

A patient's history and physical examination are essential for diagnosing SBO and determining its severity. Patients typically present with acute abdominal pain, which is often crampy and colicky, correlating with peristalsis as the bowel attempts to overcome the obstruction. The pain may become constant and severe if the obstruction worsens. Vomiting is another hallmark symptom, especially with proximal obstructions, and may start with gastric contents before becoming bilious as the obstruction becomes more distal. Persistent vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and metabolic alkalosis.

Abdominal distension, due to the accumulation of gas and fluids above the obstruction, is common and may be particularly noticeable in high or complete obstructions. Changes in bowel movements, including obstipation or decreased stool and gas passage, are also typical, though partial obstructions may still allow for some output early on.[22] A key component of the history is identifying prior abdominal surgeries, particularly those that could lead to adhesions, as postoperative adhesions are the most common cause of SBO. A history of abdominal hernias or malignancies should also be explored, as these conditions are significant risk factors for SBO. Additionally, the patientâ€™s medical history may reveal conditions like Crohn disease, radiation therapy, or neurological disorders, which can predispose them to impaired motility and SBO.

**Physical**

On physical examination, the patient may appear uncomfortable or anxious due to pain, with signs of dehydration such as dry mucous membranes and tachycardia, especially in the case of persistent vomiting. Abdominal inspection may reveal visible peristalsis and distension, particularly in thin patients. Palpation often demonstrates tenderness, especially over the obstruction site, and may reveal palpable dilated bowel loops in more severe cases. Percussion typically reveals a tympanic abdomen due to gas-filled loops, though dullness can occur in cases of fluid accumulation or bowel perforation.

Early in the obstruction, bowel sounds may be hyperactive or high-pitched as the body attempts to overcome the blockage. However, in more severe cases, bowel sounds may become absent, mainly if strangulation or ischemia is present.[23] A rectal examination may be helpful to check for fecal impaction, which could contribute to the obstruction. In some cases, the absence of stool could suggest a more proximal obstruction. Finally, if peritonitis or bowel perforation is suspected, the patient may develop signs of peritonitis, such as rigidity, rebound tenderness, and guarding, indicating a surgical emergency. This history and physical exam are critical in establishing the diagnosis, determining whether the obstruction is partial or complete, and guiding further imaging studies and treatment decisions.

## Evaluation

The evaluation of SBO involves a combination of laboratory tests, radiographic imaging, and occasionally more specialized studies. These tests are crucial for confirming the diagnosis, determining the severity and cause of the obstruction, and guiding appropriate management.

**Laboratory Tests**

Laboratory testing in SBO primarily assesses the patient's overall health, identifies complications, and helps to monitor for signs of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or infection:

  * Complete blood count (CBC) 
    * A CBC may show leukocytosis, indicating infection or inflammation, which can be seen in strangulated obstruction or peritonitis cases. Anemia may be present in cases of chronic obstruction due to subclinical blood loss or nutritional deficiencies.

  * Electrolytes and renal function 
    * A basic or comprehensive metabolic panel can assess hydration status, electrolyte imbalances (such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis), and kidney function. Vomiting, fluid sequestration in the intestines, and third-spacing of fluids can lead to dehydration, which, if severe, may result in prerenal acute kidney injury.

  * Arterial blood gas (ABG) 
    * An ABG panel

    * may reveal metabolic alkalosis in prolonged vomiting or bowel ischemia, while lactic acidosis may indicate bowel ischemia or infarction.

  * Lactate levels 
    * Elevated lactate levels can suggest tissue hypoxia, indicating ischemia or necrosis of the bowel, particularly in the context of strangulated obstruction.

  * Amylase/lipase 
    * Although these tests are typically used to evaluate pancreatitis, they may be elevated in cases of SBO if there is associated pancreatic involvement or strangulation of a segment of the small intestine.

  * Blood cultures 
    * If there is suspicion of peritonitis or sepsis due to bowel perforation or bacterial translocation, blood cultures may be warranted to guide antibiotic therapy.

**Radiographic Imaging**

Radiologic evaluation is central to confirming the diagnosis of SBO and assessing its location, severity, and complications.

**Abdominal X-Rays**

The initial imaging study of choice is usually a plain abdominal radiograph (x-ray). This study can reveal characteristic findings such as:

  * Dilated loops of small bowel 
    * Air-fluid levels are visible on upright images, indicating proximal bowel distention.

  * Absence of gas in the colon 
    * This finding suggests a complete obstruction, especially if the obstruction is distal to the small intestine.

  * Step ladder pattern 
    * This pattern of air-fluid levels in the small intestine can indicate obstruction.

  * Signs of perforation 
    * Free air under the diaphragm on an upright chest x-ray suggests perforation.

Plain radiography has poor sensitivity, with rates ranging from 50% to 80%. While radiography can serve as an initial screening test for detecting air-fluid levels or free air in the abdomen, it does not provide sufficient imaging to identify the cause, extent, or complications of SBO. A small bowel diameter greater than 6 cm is concerning and indicates a severe obstruction that may pose a high risk for compromised viability.

**CT Scan**

A CT scan of the abdomen is considered the gold standard for diagnosing SBO. CT scans are more sensitive than x-rays for detecting SBO, particularly in assessing the underlying cause. This study can help differentiate between simple and complicated (strangulated or ischemic) SBO. This imaging can be enhanced using intravenous contrast, provided the patient has normal kidney function and no contraindications. Key findings include:

  * Bowel distention 
    * This appears similar to that on x-rays but is more detailed and can help quantify the extent.

  * Transition point 
    * This is the location of the obstruction, which is critical in planning surgical or conservative management.

  * Bowel wall thickening 
    * This finding is suggestive of ischemia, inflammation, or infection.

  * Mesenteric stranding 
    * In cases of bowel ischemia or perforation, this can be seen. 

  * Signs of perforation 
    * Free air or fluid in the abdomen can indicate perforation.

  * Absence of contrast in bowel 
    * In cases of a complete obstruction, contrast may not reach beyond the obstruction site.

**Ultrasound**

Although not typically the first choice for diagnosing SBO, abdominal ultrasound can be useful, particularly in children and pregnant women, due to its noninvasive nature. Additionally, ultrasound does not result in radiation exposure and has the benefit of rapid and serial examinations.[24][25] This study can detect bowel distention, peristalsis, and the presence of fluid or air in the bowel, and is often used in cases of suspected bowel perforation or other intraabdominal pathology. The following are pathological findings that can be seen on ultrasound:

  * A dilated small bowel loop measuring more than 3 cm in diameter suggests an obstruction or ileus.

  * An edematous bowel wall measuring more than 3 mm indicates an obstruction or other intestinal inflammatory cause.

  * The noncompressibility of the bowel and the appearance of free fluid suggest obstruction.

  * Anterograde-retrograde peristalsis is specific for obstruction.

  * The visualization of a transition point is specific for obstruction. A transition point on ultrasound is demonstrated by a thick-walled, noncompressible bowel loop adjacent to a loop of decompressed small bowel.[26]

Ultrasound does not replace a CT scan and should not delay surgical consultation. This study is useful in cases where it can facilitate diagnostic evaluation and rule out other causes.[27]

**Contrast Studies**

If the diagnosis remains unclear, a contrast-enhanced study may be performed:

  * Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through 
    * This is useful if there is a suspicion of a partial obstruction or when evaluating the motility of the bowel.

  * Barium enema 
    * This is rarely used in acute SBO but can help visualize obstruction in the colon or ileocecal valve.

**Other Diagnostic Tests**

  * Endoscopy 
    * In some cases, especially if there is a concern for a nonmechanical cause such as a malignancy, endoscopic evaluation (eg, upper endoscopy or colonoscopy) may be performed. This is particularly useful for evaluating patients suspected of tumors or foreign bodies causing the obstruction.

  * Diagnostic laparoscopy 
    * In cases where the etiology of the SBO is unclear or there is a suspicion of strangulation, peritonitis, or ischemia, diagnostic laparoscopy may be employed. This minimally invasive operation allows direct visualization of the abdominal cavity, aiding in the diagnosis of the cause and in planning surgical intervention.

  * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
    * MRI is occasionally used, particularly in special circumstances such as with patients who are pregnant or when CT is contraindicated. This study provides detailed soft tissue imaging and can be useful for detecting complications like ischemia or tumors.

## Treatment / Management

The treatment and management of SBO require a multidisciplinary approach that prioritizes early recognition and intervention to optimize patient outcomes. 

**Initial Resuscitation**

The initial management of SBO begins with fluid resuscitation to address hypovolemia caused by third-spacing of fluids, vomiting, and reduced oral intake. Isotonic intravenous fluids, such as lactated Ringer or normal saline, are administered to restore intravascular volume and correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Nasogastric tube decompression is employed to alleviate gastric distension and vomiting, reduce the risk of aspiration, and provide symptomatic relief.

In prolonged cases or when surgery is delayed, nutritional support via enteral or parenteral routes may be necessary to prevent malnutrition. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting gut flora, including gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, should be administered, particularly when strangulation or perforation is suspected.[28][29][30] Surgical consultation should be obtained promptly, as many cases of SBO, especially those involving complete obstruction or signs of ischemia, require operative management.[31]

**Nonoperative Management**

Nonoperative or conservative management is suitable for simple SBO without signs of ischemia, peritonitis, or clinical deterioration. This approach involves bowel rest with the patient kept nil per os to minimize bowel distension. Serial monitoring of vital signs, abdominal exams, and laboratory tests is essential to detect any worsening condition. Water-soluble contrast studies using agents like gastrograffin can help resolve adhesional obstructions and offer prognostic value by indicating whether the obstruction may resolve without surgery.

**Indications for Surgery**

Surgical intervention is indicated for patients with evidence of strangulation, such as fever, tachycardia, localized tenderness, leukocytosis, or acidosis. Surgical intervention is imperative when SBO fails to resolve with conservative measures or when there are signs of peritonitis or bowel ischemia, ensuring timely and effective treatment.[32]

**Surgical Management**

Surgical options depend on the underlying cause of SBO. Adhesiolysis is the most common procedure, performed laparoscopically or via open surgery, to release fibrous bands causing the obstruction. For strangulated obstruction, resection of the necrotic bowel may be required, followed by either primary anastomosis or stoma formation, depending on the extent of damage and patient stability. In cases of questionable bowel viability or extensive ischemia, second-look laparotomy or temporary abdominal closure techniques, such as vacuum-assisted closure, may be required.[33][34]

Hernia-related obstructions are managed with hernia reduction and repair, while tumor-related obstructions often necessitate bowel resection, sometimes with palliative intent in advanced malignancy cases. Palliative options like octreotide can be employed for malignant obstructions.[35] Preventative strategies, such as laparoscopic techniques and barrier agents like a chemically modified membrane made of sodium hyaluronate and carboxymethylcellulose that's applied to the surface of tissues, help reduce adhesion formation.

**Postoperative Care**

Postoperative care involves close monitoring for complications such as infection, anastomotic leaks, or recurrent obstruction. Early ambulation is encouraged to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and expedite recovery. Nutritional support with gradual reintroduction of oral intake is guided by the resolution of bowel function, evidenced by decreased NG tube output, bowel sounds, and passage of gas or stool.

**Management of Functional Obstruction**

Functional obstructions, such as paralytic ileus, are treated with supportive measures, including bowel rest, correction of metabolic abnormalities, reduction in narcotic use, and the potential use of prokinetic agents like metoclopramide.

**Recurrent Obstructions**

For patients with recurrent SBO, often due to adhesions, preventive strategies may include minimally invasive surgical techniques and adhesion barriers during surgery to reduce the formation of future adhesions.

**Interdisciplinary Approach**

Optimal management of SBO relies on collaboration among surgeons, radiologists, gastroenterologists, critical care specialists, pharmacists, and nursing teams. This interdisciplinary approach enhances patient-centered care, reduces complications, and improves outcomes while minimizing the risk of recurrence.
