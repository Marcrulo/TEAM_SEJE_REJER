## Continuing Education Activity

Rhabdomyolysis is a state of muscle injury that can lead to multiple systemic manifestations, the most important of which are acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The systemic complications associated with rhabdomyolysis result from the leakage of muscle intracellular components into the bloodstream, particularly myoglobin. The etiology of rhabdomyolysis can be classified into traumatic and nontraumatic causes. Patients with traumatic rhabdomyolysis are also at risk for complications like compartment syndrome. The evaluation relies largely on levels of creatinine phosphate kinase, and muscle biopsy is indicated when underlying inherited conditions leading to myopathy are suspected. Early treatment with hydration and alkalinazation of urine is key for preventing kidney injury. This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of rhabdomyolysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**

  * Identify the potential etiologies of rhabdomyolysis based on clinical history.

  * Assess patients for associated complications of rhabdomyolysis, including acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and compartment syndrome.

  * Implement appropriate therapeutic strategies for patients with rhabdomyolysis.

  * Collaborate amongst an interprofessional team regarding strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with rhabdomyolysis.

## Introduction

Rhabdomyolysis refers to the dissolution of skeletal muscle and is characterized by leakage of muscle cell contents, myoglobin, sarcoplasmic proteins, and electrolytes into the extracellular fluid and circulation. The word rhabdomyolysis is derived from the Greek words _rhabdos_ (rod-like/striated), _mys_ (muscle), and _lysin_ (release).[1] The most common causes of rhabdomyolysis are crush injuries secondary to trauma or immobilization, extreme physical exertion, metabolic myopathies, viral illness, and electrolyte disorders.[2]

The common symptoms and signs are muscle weakness, pain, myalgias, and local swelling. Rhabdomyolysis may be associated with dark reddish-colored urine due to myoglobinuria. Clinically, rhabdomyolysis can range from mild elevation in creatinine phosphokinase to medical emergencies like compartment syndrome, intravascular fluid depletion, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pigment-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), and cardiac arrhythmias.

Laboratory diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is based on elevations of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK), the most sensitive laboratory evaluation of muscle injury; there is no specific established diagnostic serum level of CPK. Many clinicians use 3 to 5 times the upper limit of normal values of 100 to 400 U/L (approximately 1000 U/liter) for diagnosis. However, the elevation of CPK level does not determine the severity of muscle damage and renal injury.[3]

Rhabdomyolysis is a major cause of AKI.[4] If identified early, the prognosis of AKI from rhabdomyolysis is relatively benign.[5] Alternative causes for AKI, like dehydration, sepsis, and pharmaceutical-induced adverse effects, should always be considered. Seizures, alcohol use, drugs, and prolonged bedridden state are common causes of nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis.[6] Other rare causes of rhabdomyolysis include Haff disease, mushroom poisonings, and genetic disorders.[7][8]

Recognition of rhabdomyolysis can be traced back to the time when Israelites suffered from rhabdomyolysis-like symptoms after consumption of quail during their departure from Egypt. This myolysis resulted from consuming quails that ate poisonous plants (to which the quails are not susceptible) during the spring migration. A similar clinical presentation has also been reported from the Mediterranean region after consuming robins, chaffinches, and skylarks, as these birds are also not susceptible to the active alkaloids from hemlock and other poisonous herbs. In more recent times, war, earthquakes, and other man-made and natural disasters have resulted in crush injuries.[1] In 1943, Bywaters and Stead identified myoglobin as the offending agent for brown urine acute tubular necrosis through animal experiments.[9][10]

## Etiology

The etiology of rhabdomyolysis can be classified into two broad categories: traumatic or physical causes and nontraumatic or nonphysical causes.[11] Many situations are multifactorial, and it is possible that genetic susceptibility, along with one or more external insults, causes rhabdomyolysis.[12]

Careful history-taking, a comprehensive physical examination, and laboratory studies can help identify the cause of rhabdomyolysis. In addition, multiple cohort studies have shown different causes at different frequencies for rhabdomyolysis depending on the hospital location and community behaviors. 

**Traumatic or Physical Causes**

Traumatic or physical compression rhabdomyolysis can occur in different settings. Subclinical elevation of creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinemia, and myoglobinuria following physical exertion is common.

Some traumatic etiologies include the following:

  * Polytrauma, motor vehicle accidents, mining accidents, and earthquakes, particularly in patients who are trapped

  * Prolonged immobilization due to coma, intoxication with alcohol or opioids, hip fracture, and surgeries requiring specific positions for a long duration [13]

  * Abuse, torture, and the physical restraint of children

  * Fractures of lower extremities (tibial fracture) causing arterial occlusion from prolonged immobilization, tourniquet, or surgical clamping [14]

  * Fire accidents and explosions

  * High voltage electric shock and lightning strikes, which also cause direct injury to the sarcoplasmic membrane, with massive calcium influx, along with severe rhabdomyolysis [15]

  * Strenuous muscular exercise (especially in untrained individuals), lifting heavy weights, performing under exceedingly hot conditions, status epilepticus, tetanus, and rarely sepsis [16][17]

**Nontraumatic or Nonphysical Causes**

Nontraumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis can occur from a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand, electrolyte changes, and metabolic abnormalities.

  * Medications: rhabdomyolysis is a common adverse effect of many medications, particularly statins.

  * Infections: viral myositis is most common, and recently, SARS-CoV-2 is commonly associated with rhabdomyolysis.[18] See below for sepsis/bacterial infection. 

  * Electrolyte abnormalities: hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperosmolar conditions, hypo- and hypercalcemia, and severe dehydration.[19]

  * Endocrine: hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis with coma, myxedema.

  * Congenital myopathies: most common are myotonic dystrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy. See below for further details.[20]

  * Toxins: insect bite, snake venom, hornet sting, carbon monoxide, Haff disease, and mushroom poisoning.[21]

  * Autoimmune myositis: polymyositis, dermatomyositis. Please see StatPearls' companion references, "[Dermatomyositis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20389)" and "[Polymyositis](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/27417)."

  * Dysregulated body temperature: neuroleptic malignant syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, near drowning, hypothermia, and frostbite.[22] Please see StatPearls' companion references, "[Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25799)" and "[Malignant Hyperthermia](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24676)."

  * Supplements: over-the-counter vitamins, performance-enhancing supplements, and weight-loss supplements.

  * Capillary leak syndrome: caused by muscle edema. [23]

  * Drugs: Both drug intoxication and drug withdrawal can cause rhabdomyolysis.

**Statins**

Statins are the most common pharmaceutical to cause rhabdomyolysis. Up to 10% of patients taking statins experience muscle pain.[3] With the increased use of lipid-lowering drugs, the incidence of rhabdomyolysis from HMG Co-A inhibitors is rising. Muscle toxicity from statins ranges from myopathy, myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Proposed mechanisms are CoQ10 depletion-causing myocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of cellular respiration, impaired calcium homeostasis, induction of apoptosis, and anti-HMG Co-A inhibitors. Statins commonly cause toxic myopathy, associated with no muscle necrosis and CPK less than 1000 U/L, and rarely autoimmune myopathy, associated with CPK greater than 1000 U/L and muscle necrosis.[24]

Discontinuation of statins is an effective treatment method for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. However, persistent elevation of CPK after discontinuation of statins should raise concern for necrotizing autoimmune myopathy. Concomitant use of other medications like gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, cytochrome P450 inhibitors, and corticosteroids poses an increased risk for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Clinically significant rhabdomyolysis requiring hospital admission was noted in about 0.44 per 10000 patients treated with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin as monotherapy. Even though the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is very low with statin use, in clinical practice, muscle-related side effects are a frequent cause for discontinuation of statin therapy. Use of the lowest tolerable statin dose is recommended in patients with a history of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis.[24][25]

**Drug Intoxication**

Intoxicants can cause rhabdomyolysis via various mechanisms. Cocaine is a well-known instigator of rhabdomyolysis. The mechanisms involve increased sympathetic stimulation of alpha receptors in the vasculature, increased endothelin production, and decreased nitrous oxide concentrations. Cocaine is also thrombogenic, as it activates platelets and inhibits plasminogen.[26]

One study found the highest incidence of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis in those who used heroin intravenously, thought to be from local mechanical trauma from injection, with possible immune mechanisms contributing. Amphetamines also have a high rate of rhabdomyolysis, thought to be due to hyperthermia caused by amphetamine's effects on serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Alcohol, opiates, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepines may cause mechanical trauma from lying in one position for an extended period while intoxicated.[17] Withdrawal from opioids and baclofen (particularly intrathecal baclofen) has also been associated with rhabdomyolysis.[27][28] Patients with alcohol misuse disorder often have rhabdomyolysis related to direct muscle toxicity of alcohol as well as other insults, such as hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia.[29]

**Intensive Care Admission**

Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is also highly correlated with rhabdomyolysis.[2][18] ICU patients are severely ill, on multiple medications, and prone to electrolyte abnormalities; all of these factors predispose to rhabdomyolysis.[30] In addition, patients who are ventilated often receive propofol, and propofol infusion syndrome (PRIS) must be considered. PRIS is a manifestation of propofol toxicity, which is thought to result in uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This results in metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular collapse.[2] Please see StatPearls' companion reference, "[Propofol Toxicity,](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/301)" for further information

**Congenital Myopathies**

The number of congenital myopathies that can cause rhabdomyolysis is too numerous to list. Some common congenital myopathies that are known to cause rhabdomyolysis include:

Disorders of glycogenolysis: myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphorylase kinase deficiency

Disorders of glycolysis: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, mutase, and lactate dehydrogenase deficiencies

Disorders of purine metabolism: myoadenylate deaminase deficiency

Disorders of lipid metabolism: carnitine and carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiencies, short- or long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, lipin-1 deficiency, and Brody myopathy (calcium adenosine triphosphatase [CAT] deficiency) [31]

In addition, patients may not have any baseline CPK elevations but may have genetic susceptibility if exposed to external triggers. Mutations in the following genes are proposed to be associated with this risk:  _ACADVL_ ,  _ANO5_ ,  _CPT2_ ,  _DMD_ ,  _DYSF_ ,  _FKRP_ ,  _HADHA_ ,  _PGM1_ ,  _LPIN1_ ,  _PYGM_ , and  _RYR1._[12] Sickle cell trait affects 300 million people worldwide and also confers an increased risk. Rhabdomyolysis in people with sickle cell trait is especially common with exertional dyspnea. Patients with sickle cell disease are known to have rhabdomyolysis during sickle cell crises, and triggers should be avoided.[32][33][34]

**Sepsis**

Sepsis can cause rhabdomyolysis via multiple mechanisms, including direct muscle invasion by the infecting pathogen, muscle ischemia from hypoxia, toxin generation, and cytokine-mediated muscle toxicity.  _Staphylococcus aureus_ is known to cause rhabdomyolysis by direct muscle invasion and toxin production. Streptococci, salmonellae, and _S aureus_ have been demonstrated in muscle biopsies of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Other pathogens associated with rhabdomyolysis include  _Staphylococcus epidermidis,_ _Francisella tularensis, Streptococcus faecalis,_ meningococci _,_ _Hemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli,_ pseudomonads, _Klebsiella_ ,_Enterococcus faecalis,_ and _Bacteroides._[35]

## Epidemiology

Approximately 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis are reported each year in the United States. There is a large variation in the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with rhabdomyolysis; AKI is inconsistently defined, and the degree of rhabdomyolysis is highly variable.[36] Rhabdomyolysis can occur at any age, but most cases are seen in adults. Men, Black individuals, patients older than 60 years, and individuals with obesity are at increased risk. The most common cause of rhabdomyolysis in children is infection (30%). 

The incidence of crush syndrome is between 30% to 50% with traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Children are at low risk for crush syndrome and have lower mortality rates compared to adults. Crush injury-related AKI and dialysis requirements varied across multiple studies. During natural disasters like earthquakes, early fluid resuscitation, extrication, and immediate hospitalization with a multidisciplinary team approach reduce AKI, morbidity, and mortality.

In 2002, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the National Heart-Lung and Blood Institute, and the American Heart Association jointly released a clinical advisory. It defined statin-associated rhabdomyolysis as muscle symptoms with increased creatine kinase, typically more than 11 times the upper limit of normal (myonecrosis) with elevated serum creatinine consistent with pigment-induced nephropathy and myoglobinuria.[37] About 0.5% of patients taking statins might develop clinically significant myonecrosis.[38]

The incidence of rhabdomyolysis secondary to immobilization, alcohol intoxication, fractures, strenuous muscle exercises, and insect bites is imprecise, as these are more sporadic incidents. 

## Pathophysiology

There are multiple causes for rhabdomyolysis, but the final common pathogenic pathway is direct myocyte injury or energy supply failure in the muscle cell.[39] The sodium-potassium pump and sodium-calcium exchanger on the sarcoplasmic membrane maintain low intracellular/sarcoplasmic sodium and calcium and high potassium concentrations in the resting muscle. At rest, calcium is stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Muscle contraction is an active process using adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and calcium. Any insult that disrupts the ATP, ion channels, and plasma membrane results in a loss of intracellular electrolyte equilibrium.

Muscle injury (trauma, exercise, thermal dependent syndromes) or lack of myocyte intracellular ATP (medicines, electrolytes, hereditary and metabolic disorders, intense exercise, ischemia) results in intracellular sodium and calcium influx. Water is drawn into the cell along with sodium, causing cellular swelling and disruption of intracellular and membraneous structures. Excessive intracellular calcium leads to activation of actin-myosin crosslinkage, myofibrillar contraction, and depletion of ATP. Excessive intracellular calcium also activates calcium-dependent phospholipases and proteases, promoting cell membrane dissolution and disruption of ion channels.

With reperfusion, leukocytes migrate into the damaged muscle and cause an increased number of cytokines, prostaglandins, and free radicals, causing further myolysis, necrosis of muscle fibers, and release of muscle breakdown products like potassium, myoglobin, creatine kinase, phosphate, uric acid, and various organic acids into the bloodstream.[22] This leads to the complications of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. In rhabdomyolysis, hypocalcemia is observed initially, followed by hypercalcemia. This is because calcium first moves into the myocyte during injury, and then it leaks out into extracellular spaces after cell lysis. 

**Myoglobinuria**

Myoglobin is a 19 kD, iron-containing heme protein found predominantly in the sarcoplasm of skeletal and cardiac muscles. Due to the heme moiety, myoglobin carries and stores oxygen in myocytes. Myoglobin has a greater affinity for oxygen than hemoglobin and can acquire oxygen from hemoglobin, transferring oxygen from the blood to the muscle tissues.

Circulating myoglobin is mainly bound to haptoglobin and α2- immunoglobulin. However, circulating haptoglobin is saturated at serum myoglobin levels higher than 0.5 to 1.5 mg/dL, and the glomerulus filters the excess free myoglobin.[40] Although small amounts of myoglobin are normally filtered and quickly excreted by the kidneys, the large amount of myoglobin released in rhabdomyolysis can lead to AKI.[41]

**Acute Kidney Injury**

The kidney is especially vulnerable to damage from rhabdomyolysis due to its high oxygen consumption and mitochondrial density. Once muscles are damaged, their contents are released, causing inflammation and fluid sequestration. The reduction in intravascular volume activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, further compromising renal blood flow. The sympathetic nervous system is also activated, releasing vasopressin, which worsens renal ischemia.

The myoglobin released by damaged myocytes is a main contributor to renal injury. The kidney's filtering capacity becomes overwhelmed by excess myoglobin, which then deposits in renal tubules, causing renal toxicity. The myoglobin can also bind oxygen, increasing free radicals and lipid peroxidation, which causes further oxidative damage and renal vasoconstriction. Rhabdomyolysis also leads to increased uric acid production, and the acidosis facilitates myoglobin binding with uromodulin (ie, Tamm-Horsfall protein) to form tubular casts and potentiate further renal injury. Heme also binds nitrous oxide, depleting its concentration and inducing expression of the vasoconstrictors endothelin-1, isoprostanes, and thromboxanes.[3][42] In addition, heme is thought to activate platelets.[43]

The risk of AKI is estimated between 10% and 50% when CPK is greater than 1000 U/L.[3] The best predictors for developing AKI appear to be a state of hydration, high initial serum creatine, low serum bicarbonate, low serum calcium, and increased serum phosphate. Hypoalbuminemia and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have also been associated with the development of AKI. 

**Compartment Syndrome**

Trauma of muscle groups in specific compartments can lead to compartment syndrome due to muscle swelling, which further causes additional pressure-related damage like arterial occlusion and muscle necrosis. Persistently raised compartment pressure may lead to irreversible peripheral nerve palsy. Compartment pressure of more than 30 mm Hg produces significant muscle ischemia, and measurement of compartmental pressure is helpful in decision-making for fasciotomy. Patients with rhabdomyolysis, severe blood loss, and hypotension are at increased risk for muscle ischemia, even with lesser compartment pressures.[44] Patients with crush injuries are particularly susceptible to compartment syndrome.

**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation**

The heme protein has the potential to cause many inflammatory actions; it activates platelets, functions as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), induces apoptosis, damages mitochondria, activates inflammasomes, and produces cytokines. Heme is also directly thrombogenic by promoting the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and inducing platelet degranulation, macrophage activation, and tissue factor expression.[42] In an underlying inflammatory and thrombogenic state, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may also be due to thromboplastin released during muscle injury.[45][46] Laboratory values will show increased prothrombin time, activated thromboplastin time, INR, and serum D-dimer levels and decreased platelet count and fibrinogen levels. 

## Histopathology

Muscle biopsy is a necessary test when metabolic myopathies are suspected. The timing of muscle biopsy is crucial in the identification of appropriate diseases. Rhabdomyolysis can be associated with excessive muscle fiber necrosis, and obtaining a biopsy during acute injury may miss an underlying myopathy. The current literature recommends muscle biopsy only after complete recovery from rhabdomyolysis. The European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) Scientist Panels suggests patients with muscle pain, weakness, CPK elevation 2 to 3 times normal, myoglobinuria, hypertrophic or atrophic muscles, and electromyography suggestive of myopathy can undergo muscle biopsy at the time of presentation.[47]

Specific stains can help identify different types of myopathies. Glycogen storage disorders can be identified by periodic acid Schiff and hematoxylin and eosin staining showing glycogen-containing vacuoles. Succinyl dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase staining, along with Gomori trichrome staining, identify ragged red fibers in patients with mitochondrial myopathies. Immunohistochemistry can identify enzyme deficiencies like phosphokinase and myophosphorylase deficiencies.[33]

Kidney biopsy in patients with AKI from rhabdomyolysis may reveal varied findings. The earliest findings of tubular changes can be visualized via light microscopy as early as 1 to 12 hours after injury. Findings typical of this stage include dilated Bowman spaces with a ruptured glomerular membrane and reduced glomerular tufts with flattened podocytes. Significant necrosis with loss of microvilli and reduction in basal infolding is seen in the proximal convoluted tubule. Electron microscopy clearly shows electron-dense casts occupying the entire distal tubular lumen.[48]

## History and Physical

Even though muscle pain, weakness, and tea-colored urine are the characteristic triad of rhabdomyolysis, these findings are seen in less than one-half of patients. Muscle pain is the most common presenting symptom and is reported in about 50% of adults with rhabdomyolysis, and dark-colored urine is seen in about 30% to 40%.[11] Weakness typically involves proximal muscle groups. Nonspecific symptoms like muscle cramps, stiffness, muscle swelling, weakness, malaise, abdominal pain, nausea, palpitations, and fever may be present. In patients with known myopathies, weakness is the most common complaint in adults but less so in children. Depending on the cause of rhabdomyolysis, patients may report a history of illicit drug use, insect bites, heat exertion, recent surgical procedures, accidents, recent increasing dosages of regularly used medications, new medications, or over-the-counter supplements. A high index of suspicion is sometimes necessary when diagnosing rhabdomyolysis. 

Patients with underlying myopathy may have atrophic or hypertrophic muscles. The clinical features of rhabdomyolysis can be nonspecific. Rhabdomyolysis has both local and systemic features, with early and late complications. Local features include bruising, swelling, and tenderness. Systemic features include fever, malaise, nausea, confusion, agitation, delirium, tea-colored urine, or anuria.[49] In trauma patients with rhabdomyolysis, a detailed examination of distal pulses and the peripheral nerve should be evaluated for limb ischemia, compartment syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy. Signs of dehydration, such as dry oral mucosa and decreased skin turgor, should be noted. Early recognition of rhabdomyolysis is critical to preventing complications.
