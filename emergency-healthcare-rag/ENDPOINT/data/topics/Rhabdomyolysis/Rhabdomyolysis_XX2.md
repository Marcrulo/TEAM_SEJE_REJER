## Evaluation

After documenting vital signs, basic laboratory studies should be obtained. The studies should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum CPK, and urinalysis. Additionally, chest radiography and electrocardiography should be performed. In addition to CPK, lactate dehydrogenase, aldolase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase are enzymes released from muscles during rhabdomyolysis, but serum elevations of these enzymes are nonspecific. Elevated inflammatory markers and a leukocytosis are also nonspecific for rhabdomyolysis.

Elevated serum CPK levels are the hallmark of rhabdomyolysis. In addition, reddish-brown urine from myoglobinuria may be present in about 50% of cases. However, the peroxidase agent used on a urine dipstick to detect blood with also react with myoglobin. Microscopic urinalysis differentiates myoglobinuria from hemoglobinuria, as myoglobinuria is associated with an absence of red blood cells.[50]

The normal range of serum CPK is 20 to 200 U/L. Usually, an elevation of 5 times the upper limit of normal is considered necessary to diagnose rhabdomyolysis.[36] CPK exists in 4 significant isoenzymes: CK-MM, CK-MB 1 and 2, and CK-BB. CK-MM is most specific for skeletal muscle, CK-MB 1 and 2 are specific for cardiac muscle, and CK-BB is specific for the brain. The half-life of CPK is 36 hours; serum CPK levels begin to rise within 2 to 12 hours after the injury and peak within 1 to 5 days. Levels start to decline after 3 to 5 days without further muscle injury.[3][51] In general, CPK levels of more than 5000 IU/L will have some amount of significant muscle injury and place patients at higher risk of AKI.[3]

The half-life of myoglobin is 2 to 4 hours, and it is metabolized into bilirubin. Serum myoglobin can be detected before the CPK elevation, but because of the shorter half-life and rapid metabolism, myoglobinemia may not always be detectable. Sometimes, proteinuria may also be seen secondary to proteins released by damaged myocytes and changes in the glomerulus. Various other biomarkers are being investigated for early diagnosis of heme-containing pigment-induced AKI.[52]

Excessive tissue breakdown from rhabdomyolysis causes electrolyte changes, including hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. AKI can be complicated by resistant hyperkalemia. Excessive calcium influx into the myocytes can cause hypocalcemia, which may be severe depending on the nature of the injury. Excessive cell breakdown causes increased uric acid levels. Rhabdomyolysis can also cause the release of organic acids like lactic acid and contribute to metabolic acidosis with or without an anion gap.[11]

Electrocardiography may demonstrate peaked T waves, a prolonged PR interval, a wide QRS interval with or without conduction blocks, ventricular tachycardia, and asystole secondary to hyperkalemia. Hypocalcemia can manifest as QTC prolongation. 

Plain radiographs can explain underlying bone fractures, dislocation of the joints, and sometimes soft tissue swelling. Computed tomography (CT) of the involved muscle groups may identify compartment syndrome.[53] Diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome is primarily clinical; this diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring intra-compartmental pressure (invasive) or near-infrared spectroscopy (noninvasive). Additional testing like magnetic resonance imaging, muscle biopsy, or electromyography is not required to diagnose rhabdomyolysis.

Muscle biopsy is generally performed after complete recovery from rhabdomyolysis and helps identify inflammatory myopathies when suspected from the clinical history. Inflammatory and metabolic myopathies are considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent rhabdomyolysis, poor exercise tolerance, muscle cramps, easy fatigue, and a positive family history.

## Treatment / Management

The goal of rhabdomyolysis management is to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation and prevent AKI. The first step in effective management is identifying the underlying cause of the muscle injury and removing that stimulus, if possible. The active management of rhabdomyolysis should include continuous assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation, frequent physical examinations, appropriate hydration to improve end-organ perfusion, close monitoring of urine output, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and identification of complications like compartment syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation. 

**Management of Traumatic Rhabdomyolysis**

In patients with a crush injury or injuries, initiating intravenous (IV) hydration and fluid resuscitation should begin as early as possible, ideally in the field and, when possible, before relieving the injurious stimulus. Hydration should be continued during transport. Delaying fluid resuscitation may cause worsening hypovolemia secondary to third spacing. Fluids should be liberally administered to maintain adequate intravascular volume and diuresis; volumes of 10 L to 20 L may be required.[54]

Multiple studies have demonstrated the benefit of large-volume resuscitation in patients with crush injuries to prevent rhabdomyolysis-related AKI and reduce the need for hemodialysis. Patients trapped for longer periods may have already developed AKI by the time they present at the hospital; aggressive fluid resuscitation in these patients is particularly challenging, as they are prone to volume overload.[55] Unfortunately, no studies have directly compared the outcomes of different types and rates of fluid resuscitation. Current International Society of Nephrology Renal Disaster Relief Task Force guidelines recommend field resuscitation with isotonic saline rather than alkaline fluids.[56] The addition of dextrose to normal saline can be beneficial in supplying some calories and minimizing hyperkalemia. Two liters should be administered at 1 L/h for the first 2 hours, followed by 500 mL/h in a well-built adult. The rate of fluid administration is also dependent on age, gender, body habitus, the possibility of bleeding, and the nature of trauma. Potassium-containing IV fluids like Ringer's lactate are generally avoided in managing rhabdomyolysis.

Once hospitalized, close monitoring of urine output is essential. After confirming urine output and obtaining labs documenting the absence of alkalosis, consideration should be given to the alkalinization of urine to prevent the precipitation of myoglobin in the distal convoluted tubule. Urine alkalinization also decreases the precipitation of uric acid, corrects underlying metabolic acidosis, and reduces the risk of hyperkalemia. Most data regarding the alkalinization of the urine are from uncontrolled case series. Adding 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate to half-normal saline is the traditional method to alkalinize urine. Alkalinization with a bicarbonate infusion is associated with the precipitation of hypocalcemia, which can trigger tetany and seizures. The goal of alkaline fluid infusion is to maintain a serum pH not to exceed 7.5 and a urine pH just above 6.5. Bicarbonate in IV fluids should be promptly discontinued when serum pH is at 7.5.[57]

Mannitol is commonly used to improve urine output in patients with a crush injury but should only be initiated after the patient maintains adequate urine output of at least 20 mL/h. There are no specific conscientious guidelines regarding mannitol administration. A trial of intravenous infusion of 60 mL of 20% mannitol given over 5 minutes can be used to assess for increased urine output. If there is an increase in urine output of 30 to 50 mL/h compared to the baseline, mannitol can be continued.[58] Mannitol should be avoided in patients with AKI, oliguria, or anuria. Adverse events associated with mannitol use are volume overload and hyperosmolality. The current literature does not support concomitantly using mannitol and bicarbonate to prevent pigment-induced acute kidney injury.[59][60]

Every attempt should be made to prevent the development or worsening of hyperkalemia. Potassium-containing IV fluids like Ringer's lactate should be avoided. A combination of oral sodium polystyrene sulfate and sorbitol is commonly given to patients with crush injuries and hyperkalemia. The role of new potassium-binding agents is unclear because of a lack of studies. Appropriate use of point-of-care devices and electrocardiography should be utilized in patients with suspected hyperkalemia.[61]

Patients with crush syndrome should have a Foley catheter placed; IV fluids should be given to maintain urine output at 200 to 300 mL/h. Adequate IV fluid resuscitation should be continued until myoglobinuria is wholly resolved and CPK levels are down-trending. Foley catheters should be used for the shortest time possible to minimize complications like infection. Consideration should be given to loop diuretics in patients with volume overload states. Appropriate use of hemodialysis can be used with anuric AKI, hyperkalemia, and volume overload after conservative measures fail. Peritoneal dialysis is not preferred in the setting of trauma.

**Management of Nontraumatic Rhabdomyolysis**

Rhabdomyolysis from nontraumatic causes is managed similarly to that secondary to trauma. Adequate and appropriate fluid resuscitation with normal isotonic saline should be provided depending on the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis. Management includes removing the offending agent at diagnosis, titration of IV fluids to maintain a urine output of 200 to 300 mL/h, and serial daily monitoring of serum CPK levels to document trends. In patients with serum CPK levels less than 5000 U/L, aggressive fluid resuscitation is discouraged as these patients are less likely to develop AKI.[62] Forceful alkaline diuresis can be considered in severe cases where the CPK is more than 30,000 U/L without oliguria, anuria, or AKI. Mannitol is not commonly used in nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Loop diuretics can be considered in the setting of volume overload from aggressive fluid resuscitation. Patients who remain oliguric or anuric, even with aggressive fluid resuscitation, and develop AKI should be considered for hemodialysis. The role of dialysis in the removal of myoglobin has not been demonstrated.[41]

**Management of Electrolytes Abnormalities in Rhabdomyolysis**

Rhabdomyolysis is associated with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels less than 6 mEq/L without ECG changes should be managed with potassium binders and the use of bicarbonate in the fluids. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels 6 mEq/L or above with or without ECG changes should be treated with an ampule of D50 followed by 10 units of regular insulin and IV sodium bicarbonate. In general, calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is commonly used in the emergency room with hyperkalemia. However, rhabdomyolysis, especially from trauma, is associated with late occurrences of hypercalcemia, so calcium should be used with caution in the management of hyperkalemia due to rhabdomyolysis. 

Symptomatic hypocalcemia, such as tetany, seizures, and arrhythmias, should be treated with IV calcium gluconate. Excessive calcium replacement can precipitate hypercalcemia during the recovery phase. Hyperuricemia from rhabdomyolysis should be managed with allopurinol and only if the serum uric acid is more than 8 mg/dL. Patients with volume overload, severe acidosis, uremia, and refractory hyperkalemia need hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis may not be sufficient to correct the excess amount of electrolyte changes and rhabdomyolysis.

**Other Supportive Care**

Appropriate use of antibiotics and vasopressors is needed when concomitant sepsis is present. Malignant hyperthermia should be treated with dantrolene sodium. Steroids are used in inflammatory myopathies. Emergent orthopedic consultation is required in the management of compartment syndrome. DIC is managed with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelet transfusion.

**Diet in Metabolic Myopathies**

Dietary changes may improve symptoms associated with hereditary myopathies. Pain and fatigue associated with phosphorylase deficiency can be decreased with glucose and fructose supplementation. Frequent meals with a high carbohydrate, low-fat diet improve muscle pain and myoglobinuria from carnitine palmityl transferase deficiency. Other metabolic abnormalities may improve with different dietary interventions, and this should be examined closely with a dietician who specializes in such disorders.

## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis includes:

  * Hypothermia

  * Malignant hyperthermia

  * Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

  * Sepsis

  * Inflammatory myositis

  * Inherited myopathies

  * Guillain-Barré syndrome

  * Hyperosmolar conditions

## Pertinent Studies and Ongoing Trials

Preclinical studies have been conducted on the following interventions in rhabdomyolysis but have not proven effective:

  * Vasodilators

  * Antioxidants

  * Curcumin

  * Haptoglobin

  * Hemopexin

  * Hepcidin

  *  _α_ 1-microglobulin.

Gene therapy is being explored for treating inherited muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne and Becker. This includes various technologies such as read-through of early stop codons and exon skipping. Edasalonexent (CAT-1004, an NF-κB inhibitor) combines structural elements of salicylic acid and docosahexenoic acid and has also been tested in a phase 3 placebo-controlled clinical trial with some success ([NCT03703882](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03703882)). Vamorolone is a glucocorticoid that stabilizes membranes by reducing lipid peroxidation and inhibiting NF-kB-mediated inflammation; it has also demonstrated functional improvement of symptoms. Many other novel treatments are being studied.[20][63]

## Prognosis

For hospitalized patients who develop AKI in the setting of rhabdomyolysis, the mortality rate is 30% to 50%. Severity and duration of the renal injury are the most significant prognostic indicators.[3] There is also a correlation between the severity and duration of crush injury and the need for hemodialysis.[64]

## Complications

The most significant complications of rhabdomyolysis include:

  * Acute kidney injury

  * Electrolyte abnormalities

  * Arrhythmias

  * Compartment syndrome

  * Disseminated intravascular coagulation 

  * End-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy

  * Infections from a prolonged hospital stay.

## Consultations

Acute rhabdomyolysis patients, both traumatic and nontraumatic, with AKI, hyperkalemia, compartment syndrome, hypotension, or arrhythmias, should be admitted to the ICU and may require ventilatory support. Consulting critical care, nephrologist, trauma surgeon, vascular surgeon, or orthopedic surgeon may be needed depending on the severity and cause of rhabdomyolysis. 

## Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients with rhabdomyolysis should be educated about the risk factors and how they can avoid this in the future. Patients with suspected inflammatory and metabolic myopathies need further workup, including biopsy. Survivors of traumatic rhabdomyolysis syndrome may need counseling and medications if needed. For patients diagnosed with genetic metabolic abnormalities, family members should be screened for heritable causes.

## Pearls and Other Issues

  * Rhabdomyolysis can be classified into traumatic and non-traumatic causes.

  * Elevated CPK levels are the most sensitive test for diagnosis.

  * Usually, CPK levels must be higher than 5000 U/L for systemic damage to occur, but other factors can also affect this.

  * Patients with crush injury or massive trauma are at risk for compartment syndrome. Checking distal pulses and measuring compartment pressures are key to monitoring for this. Compartment pressures over 30 mm Hg place patients at high risk for muscle ischemia.

  * DIC can also occur with rhabdomyolysis due to activated platelets and a proinflammatory state.

  * The key to minimizing kidney injury is to maintain high urine output and alkalinization of urine to avoid cast precipitation.

  * Patient's with recurrent rhabdomyolysis or who develop this condition with minimal trauma or exertion should be screened for genetic abnormalities.

  * People with sickle cell trait are at risk of rhabdomyolysis and special precautions should be taken with organized sports and physical exertion. 

  * The symptoms of genetic myopathies can sometimes be treated by dietary changes.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

Many studies on rhabdomyolysis management lack good quality randomized control trials. Rhabdomyolysis can have significant morbidity on the patient, and the key is education on prevention. When patients are discharged, the nurse and pharmacist play a vital role in educating the patient and the family on the causes of muscle breakdown and how to prevent them. College and high school students need to be educated regarding heat-related injuries and the importance of hydration. Patients with rhabdomyolysis may also need to enter a rehabilitation or a physical therapy program to regain muscle mass and recover joint function. Many patients take months to recover the muscle mass even after recovery, and some even have residual pain for a few years. Finally, the pharmacist should warn the public about the risk of rhabdomyolysis associated with recreational drugs, alcohol, or prescription medications.

Lastly, care coordination is pivotal in ensuring seamless and efficient patient care. Physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals must work together to streamline the patient's journey, from diagnosis through treatment and follow-up. This coordination minimizes errors, reduces delays, and enhances patient safety, ultimately leading to improved outcomes and patient-centered care that prioritizes the well-being and satisfaction of those affected by rhabomyolysis. With an interprofessional healthcare team approach to diagnosis and care that includes primary clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, patients with rhabdomyolysis can achieve good outcomes and avoid the long-term sequelae of this condition.
