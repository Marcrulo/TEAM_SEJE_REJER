## Continuing Education Activity

Pain is one of the most common reasons a patient seeks medical care. Various modalities may be used to relieve pain, and one of them is the administration of opiates. Opiates and opioids are strong pain relievers derived from the plant _Papaver somniferum_. Conventionally, the term "opiates" refers to natural compounds obtained from the poppy flower base, while "opioids" are synthetic agents with similar effects.

Opiates have been formally approved for analgesia for nearly 70 years, and these drugs have been assumed to be relatively safe despite the potential consequences of overdosing, including central nervous system and respiratory depression resulting in arrest. However, many reports in the last 2 decades have raised concerns about the safety of these drugs. Opiate prescriptions have dramatically increased over this period, with the United States currently experiencing an opioid epidemic with fatal consequences. Overdose and toxicity cases are on the rise and are continually reported in all major cities. Empirical prescription habits by healthcare workers to relieve pain have also led to an epidemic of overdose outside the healthcare setting, with the eruption of clandestine laboratories manufacturing synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and distributing them on the street.

This activity for healthcare professionals is designed to enhance learners' proficiency in evaluating and managing opioid toxicity. Participants gain a deeper understanding of the condition's risk factors, etiology, toxicology, pathophysiology, presentations, and evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The course highlights the use of opioid reversal agents such as naloxone to reduce morbidity and mortality. Emphasis shall be given to the role of healthcare professionals in treating opioid use disorder through medication-assisted and nonpharmacologic approaches to support recovery and abstinence. Greater competence equips clinicians to collaborate effectively within an interprofessional team caring for affected individuals, improving outcomes.

**Objectives:**

  * Apply toxicokinetic data when evaluating the progression of opioid overdose and toxicity.

  * Select the appropriate diagnostic tests to differentiate opioid overdose from conditions that can present with similar signs and symptoms.

  * Implement individualized combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments for managing opioid toxicity.

  * Collaborate with the interprofessional team to educate, treat, and monitor patients with opioid toxicity to improve health outcomes.

## Introduction

The term "opiate" refers to natural compounds derived from the base of the _Papaver somniferum_ poppy flower, such as opium, morphine, diacetylmorphine (heroin), and codeine.[1] In contrast, opioids are synthesized through chemical processes and include methadone, oxycodone, and fentanyl. Opiates have been used since antiquity to relieve pain and induce euphoria. Today, these agents remain a widely used option for pain relief. Opiates have been formally approved for analgesia for nearly 70 years and have long been assumed to be relatively safe and nonaddictive when used for chronic pain.[2]

In 1995, Dr. James Campbell addressed the American Pain Society, advocating for the evaluation of pain as a vital sign.[3] His intentions were well-meaning, motivated by concerns about the undertreatment of pain. However, over the past 2 decades, numerous reports have raised alarms about the safety of these drugs. Cases of overdose and opiate toxicity are reported regularly across major cities in the United States. Particularly concerning is the dramatic increase in opiate prescriptions over the same period. This widespread prescribing by healthcare providers has contributed to an epidemic of overdoses outside the healthcare setting. Consequently, practicing healthcare professionals should recognize opiate toxicity in patients who present as lethargic or unresponsive without an apparent cause. ([CDC,](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/index.html) 2017)

Data released by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that, from 2001 through 2010, the rates of opiate diversion, opiate prescriptions, and opiate-related deaths exponentially increased in the United States. These rates plateaued from 2011 through 2013 but spiked again between 2013 and 2014. Experts in pain management believe that the high number of opiate overdoses is likely unintentional, as patients may have been attempting to manage unrelenting pain. (CDC, 2016)

Prescriptions for opioid-containing medications quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, paralleling a 4-fold increase in overdose deaths due to opioids. The majority of opioid-related deaths are attributed to the use of heroin and synthetic opioids other than methadone.

The issue of poorly treated pain has led medical professionals to use various short- and long-acting opiates. While this approach has significantly improved pain relief, some patients often fail to adhere to proper dosing. When patients increase the dose or duration of opioid use, toxicity becomes a potential complication. Although the annual rates of transition are low, toxicity often occurs when individuals move from the nonmedical use of prescription opioids to heroin.

Opioid overdose occurs when excessive unopposed stimulation of the opiate pathway leads to decreased respiratory effort and, potentially, death. The frequency of opioid overdoses is rapidly increasing. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, with opioids being the most common culprit. According to the CDC, more than 1,000 emergency department visits reported daily are related to opioid misuse, and about 91 opioid overdose deaths are documented every day.

Heroin, priced at about $2 per bag, is up to 10 times cheaper and more readily available than prescription opioid medications purchased on the street, which average around a dollar per milligram. Additionally, heroin is increasingly being mixed with fentanyl and other synthetic opioid compounds, resulting in variable opioid potency and a higher risk of overdose.

Nonpharmaceutical or "street" opioids are often contaminated with other substances. To increase profits, sellers frequently add additional agents to the formula without informing the end user. These additives are pharmacologically active in many cases. Heroin was adulterated with scopolamine 2 decades ago in New York City, causing severe anticholinergic toxicity. Cocaine adulteration is also prevalent.[4][5][6][7]

**Prescription Monitoring**

Most states have established prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to counter the liberal prescribing of opiates by healthcare workers. In many states, healthcare professionals must consult the state’s online drug database to determine which analgesic drugs may be prescribed to patients. Such state-enacted legislation aims to prevent mass opiate prescriptions by healthcare workers and to help stop the diversion of legitimate opiate prescriptions. (DEA, 2016) Results are mixed, but research suggests that opioid databases have reduced opioid prescribing.[8]

Additionally, with the assistance of the DEA, statewide registries of controlled substances now help healthcare providers track usage patterns among patients to identify people at high risk for opiate diversion or abuse. While the availability of opiates contributes to opioid addiction, no evidence has yet demonstrated a direct link between opiate abuse and the legitimate use of these drugs for pain. ([DEA](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/faq/rx_monitor.htm), 2016)

## Etiology

Both opioids and opiates act on 3 major classes of opioid receptors: μ, κ, δ, and several minor classes, such as nociceptin and ζ. Simply put, μ-receptors are thought to provide analgesia, respiratory suppression, bradycardia, physical dependence, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and euphoria. Agonism of κ-receptors can lead to hallucinations, miosis, and dysphoria. The δ-receptor likely contributes to pain control and mood modulation, but some suggest that μ agonism is necessary for the δ-receptor to function effectively in analgesia.[9][10] Causes of opioid overdose include substance abuse, unintentional and intentional overdose, and therapeutic drug error.

The risk of opioid overdose increases in the following situations:

  * Taking escalating doses

  * Returning to use after cessation

  * Having severe medical and psychiatric conditions, such as depression, HIV infection, and lung or liver disease

  * Combining opioids with sedative medications

  * Being male

  * Being younger (20 to 40 years)

  * Being of White non-Hispanic race [11][12]

More than 1.5 million emergency department visits are related to opioid analgesic use. Opioid overdose is a common cause of death.

## Epidemiology

**Impact of the Opioid Crisis in the United States**

Opiates are frequently prescribed for moderate to severe pain in the United States. These drugs may be prescribed alone or combined with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or muscle relaxants. Based on data from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders Systems, the percentage increases in opiate use from 2004 through 2011 were as follows:

  * Buprenorphine 2318%

  * Fentanyl 35%

  * Hydromorphone 140%

  * Methadone 37%

  * Morphine 64%

  * Oxycodone 117%

Meanwhile, the use of codeine decreased by 20%.

Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has revealed that abuse of all the above opiates increased, with hydromorphone and buprenorphine leading the way with a 438% and 384% increase, respectively. ([SAMHSA](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/DAWN-SR192-BenzoCombos-2014/DAWN-SR192-BenzoCombos-2014.pdf), 2014) Other reports from DAWN reveal that nearly 420,000 documented emergency room visits in 2013 were related to opiates. Cases of abuse and diversion of opiates over the past decade have included drugs like hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, and tramadol.

In 2015, United States poison control centers reported a total of 18,425 exposures to pure opiates, which resulted in 68 fatalities and 764 cases of major toxicity. Additionally, 14,632 cases involved exposure to combinations of opiates with alcohol, benzodiazepines, aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. The combined exposures resulted in 32 fatalities and 288 cases of severe toxicity. ([AAPCC,](http://www.aapcc.org/press/81/) 2017) The opioid crisis was reported to claim about 128 lives per day in 2018.[13]

**Global Consequences of the Opioid Epidemic**

The opiate toxicity epidemic is not limited to the United States but is also a worldwide concern. According to the 2014 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, at least 0.4% of the population, or nearly 20 million people, regularly use heroin or opium. The highest usage rates are found in Southwest Asia (1.21%), followed by Southeastern and Eastern Europe (0.83%), and Transcaucasia and Central Asia (0.81%).

In Europe, opioid-related deaths have been primarily linked to the illicit use of fentanyl and its analogs. In countries experiencing a heroin shortage, fentanyl and related products have replaced heroin as the illicit drug of choice. In Russia and Ukraine, desomorphine, known as "krokodil" on the street, is inexpensive and easy to produce from codeine. Besides being 10 times more potent than morphine, the unrefined synthesis methods cause skin abscesses, necrosis, and other life- and limb-threatening complications for users.[14]

## Pathophysiology

Opioids exert their clinical effects by interacting with the opioid receptor, which has 3 subtypes: μ, κ, and δ. These receptors are all G-protein-linked and are found throughout the human body. Each subtype produces different clinical manifestations when activated.[15]

μ-receptors mediate analgesia, euphoria, sedation, respiratory depression, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and physical dependence. These receptors reduce the medullary response to hypercarbia and decrease the respiratory response to hypoxia, leading to a diminished stimulus to breathe and the development of apnea. μ-receptors are concentrated in the brain, where they regulate analgesia; in the mesolimbic system, which is responsible for euphoria and reward; and in the medulla, which regulates respiration.

κ-receptors mediate analgesia, diuresis, miosis, and dysphoria primarily within the spinal cord. Stimulation of this receptor subtype is not associated with constipation or significant changes in respiration. μ-receptor-specific antagonists do not reverse analgesia provided by κ-receptor stimulation.[16]

δ-receptors mediate analgesia, inhibit dopamine release, and suppress cough. Less is known about the stimulation of this receptor, but it is believed to play a smaller role in behavior reinforcement.

Opioids may be agonists, partial agonists, or agonist-antagonists of opioid receptors, which are located in the brain, spinal cord, and gastrointestinal tract. In overdose, excessive stimulation of the μ-opioid receptors in the brain that regulate respiratory rate leads to respiratory depression and, ultimately, death by respiratory arrest. The typical symptoms of overdose include pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression, and a decreased level of consciousness, which, together, form the “opioid overdose triad.”

The roles of the σ- and δ-opioid receptors are less well understood. However, hallucinations, dysphoria, and psychosis may develop when σ-receptors are stimulated. Stimulation of δ-receptors can produce analgesia, euphoria, and seizures. σ-receptors are no longer considered opioids because they are not antagonized by naloxone.

Tolerance occurs rapidly with opioids. In overdose, patients often succumb to respiratory failure. Tolerance to the loss of the hypercarbia drive takes longer to develop than tolerance to other euphoric effects, but opioid-tolerant patients do not develop complete tolerance to the loss of the hypoxic stimulus, leaving them susceptible to death from overdose.[17][18][19]

## Toxicokinetics

Opiates may be administered intravenously, topically, inhalationally, intramuscularly, and orally. Peak opiate effects are reached within 5 to 10 minutes following intravenous administration but may take up to 90 minutes if the oral route is used. Drugs like heroin and butorphanol can reach peak levels within 10 to 15 minutes after nasal insufflation and about 30 to 45 minutes following intramuscular injection. Fentanyl, which is the only available topical analgesic agent, often takes 2 to 4 hours to reach peak levels.

Most orally administered opiate is absorbed in the small intestine. Large opiate doses can lead to gastric aperistalsis and a delay in gastric emptying, resulting in increased absorption of the drug. Once in the body, opiates are metabolized by the liver into inactive compounds, which are primarily excreted by the kidneys. Opiates such as buprenorphine and fentanyl are highly lipid-soluble and tend to redistribute into fatty tissues, resulting in a prolonged half-life. Since all opiates are metabolized by the liver, they tend to have a long half-life when consumed in the presence of liver dysfunction (eg, cirrhosis). Opiate toxicity in patients with this condition can occur rapidly, even with small doses, as the drug remains in the body for an extended period.

The hepatic microsomal CYP2D6 enzyme breaks down codeine into the active metabolite morphine. Some individuals carry more than 2 copies of the enzyme, making them ultrarapid metabolizers who quickly convert codeine into morphine. These people may develop morphine toxicity if they take even normal doses of codeine. This same mechanism of ultrarapid breakdown explains why tramadol may also cause opiate toxicity. After being metabolized in the liver, opiate metabolites are excreted in the urine. Individuals with renal dysfunction may experience adverse effects from the accumulation of active metabolites, such as normeperidine. Several studies indicate that long-acting opiates used for noncancer pain may increase the risk of adverse cardiac events compared to tricyclics or anticonvulsants.

**Formulas of Opiates and Delivery**

In the past, opiates were only available in oral and injectable formulations. Today, dermal, sublingual, and inhaler formulas are also sold in the market. Butorphanol comes in an intranasal form, and fentanyl is available both as a topical and an inhaler.

The transdermal delivery of opiates like fentanyl has become widely accepted in healthcare settings for analgesic relief. This delivery route is preferred because drug levels take 4 to 6 hours to peak, and the elimination half-life is long, making it suitable for patients with chronic, continuous pain. Additionally, this route rarely precipitates toxicity because of the relatively prolonged, slow onset of action. However, the topical formulation of fentanyl can contribute to the toxicity of parenteral and oral opiates.

Dextromethorphan was once widely available in many over-the-counter cough preparations. However, this product is no longer sold without regulation because of diversion. Although dextromethorphan was an over-the-counter preparation, high doses were known to cause sedation and even respiratory depression due to its chemical similarity to codeine. Additionally, using dextromethorphan in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors can lead to life-threatening serotonin syndrome, which may result in adverse cardiac events.

Tramadol (Ultram) is classified as a nonopiate analgesic. However, this product has a dual mode of action, acting on both nonopiate and opiate receptors. Tramadol has a comparatively long duration of action, lasting 5 to 6 hours. Naloxone administration is recommended for patients known to have overdosed on tramadol, with most individuals requiring repeated doses or a continuous intravenous infusion.

Many clandestine laboratories have emerged across the nation due to the difficulty of legally obtaining prescription opiates. These laboratories operate under unsterile conditions and use impure substances, resulting in more toxic drugs being sold on the street. Another challenge with illicit drugs produced in clandestine laboratories is that many cannot be detected using standard toxicological screens because of their structural dissimilarities.

Several synthetic fentanyl derivatives, such as α-methylfentanyl, are circulating on the street and are extremely potent. Multiple deaths have been reported, with users found with needles still in their arms. Another synthetic derivative, 3-methylfentanyl, is thousands of times more potent than morphine. Extremely high doses of intravenous naloxone infusions are required for people overdosing on this agent. Deaths from these fentanyl derivatives often occur in clusters, as sellers move from street to street, causing multiple fatalities along the way.

Pentazocine is classified as a partial agonist-antagonist and is used to treat moderate to severe pain. This drug works by stimulating the κ-opiate receptors and inhibiting the μ-opiate receptors. The drug shares many adverse effects common to other opiates. However, a unique feature of pentazocine is its potential to cause nightmares, hallucinations, and delusions. Pentazocine has a high ceiling effect, meaning that a high dose must be reached before further drug administration stops providing additional pain relief, although the risk of side effects still increases. The pharmacological effects of pentazocine may be reversed by naloxone, but extremely high doses (10 to 115 mg) are required.

Propoxyphene is an opiate analgesic once prescribed to manage mild pain and cough. Sporadic cases of poisoning with this drug continued even after it was withdrawn from the American market in 2010 due to concerns about serious adverse cardiac events. Despite the ban, the drug remains available illegally and contributes to a significant number of poisonings each year. Naloxone can reverse the toxicity of propoxyphene but does not address the cardiac arrhythmias caused by the drug. These arrhythmias, resulting from the quinidine-like effects of propoxyphene, are unresponsive to naloxone. Propoxyphene can cause sinus bradycardia, heart block, and ventricular arrhythmias. Immediate treatment involves the administration of sodium bicarbonate.

The combination of diphenoxylate and atropine is commonly used to treat diarrhea. The opioid diphenoxylate acts as an antidiarrheal agent. The anticholinergic atropine is added to deter deliberate misuse and overdose. Atropine itself has no antidiarrheal activity. High doses of this combination can cause primarily anticholinergic side effects, respiratory depression, and constipation. Cardiac toxicity, including prolongation of the QRS and QTc intervals leading to ventricular arrhythmias, is the main concern with the use of this drug combination.

**Body Packers and Stuffers**

Transporting illicit drugs in the body has become increasingly common over the past 2 decades. These individuals, often called "drug mules" or "carriers," ingest drugs contained in plastic bags or condoms. The number of packages ingested typically ranges from 1 to 3 dozen. Some may rupture despite being well-packaged, leading to systemic toxicity. Others may develop complications such as bowel obstruction and intestinal perforation, requiring surgery. Additionally, when pursued by law enforcement, these individuals may quickly swallow smaller quantities of drugs to evade arrest. Body stuffers are at a higher risk of adverse effects, as the drugs they transport are often improperly packaged. Symptoms can appear rapidly following ingestion, and aggressive medical intervention is often necessary to prevent overdose and death.
