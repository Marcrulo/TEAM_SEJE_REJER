## Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of opioid poisoning includes conditions presenting with sudden-onset respiratory or CNS depression, as follows:

  * Barbiturate toxicity 

  * Benzodiazepine toxicity

  * Carbon monoxide toxicity 

  * Clonidine toxicity 

  * Cyanide toxicity

  * Diabetic ketoacidosis

  * Ethanol toxicity 

  * Ethylene glycol toxicity 

  * γ-Hydroxybutyrate toxicity

  * Hypercalcemia

  * Hypernatremia

  * Hypothermia

  * Hypoglycemia 

  * Meningitis/encephalitis 

  * Neuroleptic agent toxicity

  * Traumatic brain injury

  * Valproic acid toxicity

Efficient and thorough evaluation of these alternative diagnoses ensures timely intervention and better outcomes.

## Prognosis

**Mortality and Morbidity**

Death from opioid overdose is on the rise. One study found that deaths from opioid-only overdose increased by 384% between 1999 and 2018. Polysubstance overdose deaths increased by 760% over the same period in adolescents and young adults.[38] According to the CDC, nearly 108,000 individuals succumbed to opioid overdose in 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic response also led to an increase in mortality, as it limited access to treatment services.

The primary cause of morbidity and mortality following an opiate overdose is respiratory arrest. Seizures, acute lung injury, and adverse cardiac events may also occur but are less common. Individuals with preexisting lung pathology who overdose on opiates face a significantly higher risk of respiratory distress and death compared to the general population. Another factor contributing to opiate toxicity is the presence of coingestants, with the eventual toxicity depending on the type of substance involved. A Canadian study found that the risk of fatal opiate toxicity doubled when opiates were taken with gabapentin, which is also known to depress respiration. Additionally, morbidity and mortality are influenced by the intent behind the opiate ingestion. Individuals attempting suicide often consume multiple drugs simultaneously, substantially increasing the risk of death.

**Prognosis**

If the patient does arrest in the setting of a pure opiate overdose, the cause in most cases is severe hypotension, hypoxia, and poor brain perfusion. The outcome for these individuals is poor.

## Complications

Opiate toxicity can also produce complications beyond the typical respiratory and CNS adverse effects.[39][40][41] The most common ones are discussed in this section.

**Acute Lung Injury**

Acute lung injury is a well-known complication of heroin overdose. However, this condition may also occur after overdoses involving methadone and propoxyphene and is almost universally observed in patients who succumb to high doses of opiates. The exact mechanism by which opiates cause lung injury remains unclear, but the outcome is hypoventilation and hypoxia caused by noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Clinically, heroin-induced lung injury presents with sudden onset of dyspnea, frothy sputum production, cyanosis, tachypnea, and rales—symptoms consistent with pulmonary edema. Acute lung injury has also been reported in children who ingest high doses of opiates. The presentation is very similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most cases resolve with aggressive airway management and oxygen therapy, including positive pressure ventilation. Standard medications for pulmonary edema are typically avoided, as diuretics may worsen hypotension.[42]

**Infection**

Complications of intravenous opioid use include abscesses, cellulitis, and endocarditis. Gram-positive bacteria, such as _Staphylococcus_ and _Streptococcus,_ are the most common organisms involved. If these bacteria enter the systemic circulation, the risk of additional complications like epidural abscess and vertebral osteomyelitis increases. These conditions often present with symptoms such as fever and persistent back pain.

Some individuals who inject drugs directly into the neck risk developing jugular vein thrombophlebitis, Horner syndrome, and pseudoaneurysms of the carotid artery. Both peripheral and pulmonary emboli have been reported in people who inject opioids. Accidental injection into nerves may also cause permanent neuropathy.

Endocarditis is a serious complication of intravenous drug use, often resulting from injecting illicit drug mixtures with contaminated needles. Diagnosing infectious endocarditis can be challenging due to the initially vague symptoms. While right-sided heart valves are most commonly affected, left-sided valves may also be involved in some cases. The tricuspid valve is the valve most frequently affected in individuals who use intravenous drugs. Endocarditis often presents with fever, malaise, and a new murmur. In some patients, recurrent septic pulmonary embolism may be the only presenting feature.

The organism most commonly involved in right-sided endocarditis is _Staphylococcus aureus_. In contrast, left-sided endocarditis may be polymicrobial, involving organisms such as _Streptococcus_ , _E. coli_ , _Pseudomonas_ , and  _Klebsiella_. Symptoms and signs tend to be more pronounced in left-sided endocarditis compared to right-sided cases.

Other infectious manifestations of opioid abuse include recurrent pneumonia, with aspiration pneumonia occurring in some unconscious individuals. Necrotizing fasciitis, another life-threatening complication, often presents with severe pain, fever, and dark, dusky skin with crepitus. The individual may show signs of septic shock. Aggressive resuscitation and immediate surgical debridement can be life-saving. 

**Musculoskeletal and Neurologic Sequelae**

Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively common complication of opioid overdose that may occur even without compartment syndrome. Opioids are likewise known to increase the risk of seizures, particularly drugs like propoxyphene, meperidine, pentazocine, intravenous fentanyl, and heroin. The individual may present with a prolonged seizure, which may result from CNS hypoperfusion and hypoxia or from intracranial injury due to a fall.

**Narcotic Bowel Syndrome**

Narcotic bowel syndrome is a type of opiate-induced bowel pathology characterized by frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe abdominal pain that worsens with escalating or continued opiate doses. This syndrome typically occurs in individuals without prior bowel pathology and represents a maladaptive response. Narcotic bowel syndrome may also be associated with intermittent vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation. Eating tends to aggravate the symptoms, which can last for days or weeks. Anorexia may result in weight loss, and delayed gastric emptying and intestinal transit are delayed.

The syndrome is often mistaken for bowel obstruction. The key to diagnosis lies in recognizing that continued and escalating opiate doses worsen abdominal pain rather than provide relief. Treatment for narcotic bowel syndrome involves psychotherapy, as well as tapering or discontinuing the opioid. Successful treatment depends on developing a strong patient-physician relationship and trust, gradually withdrawing the narcotic, and using nonpharmacological treatments to manage pain.

**Withdrawal Reaction**

Withdrawal symptoms following cessation of opiates are common, but they are often vague and less severe than those observed with alcohol or benzodiazepine discontinuation. The onset of symptoms depends on the drug ingested, typically occurring within 2 to 4 days after methadone cessation and 8 to 10 hours after meperidine withdrawal. Autonomic symptoms may include excessive lacrimation, sweating, piloerection, rhinorrhea, repeated yawning, myalgia, nasal congestion, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms usually peak between 36 and 48 hours and gradually subside within 72 hours.

Symptoms may last 7 to 14 days in chronic drug addicts. Treatment for withdrawal symptoms is supportive, and the use of additional opiates to counter withdrawal symptoms is not recommended. Clonidine may be used in severe withdrawal cases, especially when methadone is inappropriate or unavailable. After acute treatment, the patient should be referred to a long-term drug rehabilitation program to help prevent relapse.

## Deterrence and Patient Education

In early 2015, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged the expanded use of naloxone among healthcare professionals to counter opiate overdoses nationwide. Now, pharmacists, EMS personnel, and physicians can all play an active role in preventing opiate overdoses. Current recommendations also suggest coprescribing naloxone to patients taking opiates. Several studies show that patients who receive naloxone alongside an opiate prescription have fewer opiate-related emergency room visits than those who do not. Today, some healthcare workers have started prescribing naloxone to patients on high doses of opiates.

Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of a handheld autoinjector that can be prescribed to caregivers or family members for managing suspected opiate overdoses. Additionally, numerous naloxone organizations have emerged across the country to fight the opiate overdose epidemic, including efforts to involve nonmedical professionals like law enforcement officers.

## Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes 

With the drastic increase in opioid abuse and overdose-related deaths, much attention has focused on this so-called "opioid epidemic." All healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners who prescribe controlled substances, have a role in reducing the opioid epidemic and should be equipped to identify and treat those experiencing toxicity and overdose.

New research focuses on finding effective interventions and identifying risk factors for overdose. Some of these efforts include treatment programs, take-home intranasal naloxone, and monitored injection facilities. A review of research exploring overdose education and naloxone distribution suggests reduced fatality rates for patients who receive counseling and prescriptions for home naloxone.

Naloxone has been shown to have a very safe side effect profile. Several studies on opiate-naive patients who received large doses of the drug showed no significant effects. However, acute opioid withdrawal symptoms may develop when this agent is administered to opioid-tolerant patients. Individuals given naloxone in the setting of opioid overdose may experience sudden withdrawal syndrome, manifesting as aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting also occur in about 30% of patients. Most symptoms are not severe or sustained, and less than 1% of patients require admission. Acute withdrawal symptoms are more likely with larger doses of naloxone. Despite the risk of precipitated withdrawal, naloxone should not be withheld in cases of acute opioid overdose with respiratory depression.[43][44]

An interprofessional approach should involve physicians, nurses, and substance abuse counselors. The goal of the collaborative efforts of this group is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with OUD.
