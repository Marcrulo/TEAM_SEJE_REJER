## Pathophysiology

Aspiration pneumonia occurs when bacteria-rich fluid from the oropharynx or upper GI tract is aspirated into the lungs in sufficient quantities to overcome protective physiologic mechanisms against infection. Intact swallow and cough reflexes prevent aspiration in adequate amounts to produce pneumonia. However, impaired swallow or cough reflexes permit aspirated material to reach the alveoli, causing infection. Even small amounts of aspirated secretions can incite infection in patients with a high bacterial load.[1] Notably, overt aspiration events often go unnoticed, with microaspiration, or silent aspiration, central to the pathophysiological mechanism underlying aspiration pneumonia.[2]

While the bacterial load in microaspirations may be minimal, recurrent microaspirations can progressively lead to recurrent aspiration pneumonia over time due to repetitive epithelial injury caused by frequent aspiration events that denude the pulmonary epithelium. Ultimately, the mucociliary transport mechanism and the macrophage-dependent clearance of aspirated material become compromised. In individuals with compromised immunity, subsequent exposure to aspirated organisms in the alveolar space precipitates infection.[4]

Various interacting mechanisms can contribute to impaired swallowing. In older adults, diminished pharyngeal sensory perception for swallowing and coughing significantly influence impaired swallowing. Additionally, asynchronous breathing patterns during swallowing, characterized by inhalation instead of exhalation, can lead to aspiration. Other predisposing factors include reduced saliva production, ineffective dentition, and delayed laryngeal closure. Furthermore, with aging, the upper esophageal sphincter may decrease in cross-sectional area, resulting in more significant amounts of pharyngeal residue and increasing the risk of aspiration.[1]

In the absence of infection, lung fluid is typically considered sterile. However, recent advancements in culture-independent molecular techniques have identified the lung microbiome, which shares many microbes with the normal flora of the oropharynx. A disequilibrium of oropharyngeal bacterial communities is thought to contribute to decreased lung resistance to colonization and a diminished ability to contain potential pathogens. This notion is supported by the predominance of aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens as the leading causes of infection in hospitalized patients with aspiration pneumonia.

While anaerobic bacteria were historically considered the dominant cause of aspiration pneumonia, they are now regarded as infrequent causative pathogens.[3] The consensus is that aspiration pneumonia is polymicrobial, with aerobic gram-negative bacilli as the predominant pathogens and aerobic gram-positive organisms as the second most common cause.[1]

## History and Physical

Inconsistent definitions and diagnostic practices have posed challenges in delineating a clear clinical profile of patients with aspiration pneumonia. The overlap of aspiration events and the typical clinical presentation further complicates distinguishing aspiration pneumonia from aspiration pneumonitis. Broadly, patients with aspiration pneumonia typically exhibit characteristics such as older age, frailty, malnutrition, and bedridden status, often accompanied by multiple comorbidities, especially cerebrovascular disease.[5]

Patients with aspiration pneumonia commonly exhibit clinical symptoms associated with CAP, including cough, fever, and malaise, which can obscure the distinction between the 2 conditions. In cases where CAP is suspected, obtaining a comprehensive history regarding current or previous dysphagia, instances of aspiration, coughing during eating or drinking, and other medical conditions predisposing to overt or silent aspiration aids in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia.[5]

As outlined earlier, aspiration in patients with pneumonia does not unequivocally signify aspiration pneumonia. However, given the heightened frequency of aspiration events in older adults and the increased pneumonia risk in patients with dysphagia or microaspirations, the current recommendation is to regard aspiration pneumonia as the probable cause of pneumonia in elderly patients, and efforts should be made to evaluate and manage impaired swallowing thoroughly.[5] Conversely, a history of large-volume overt or witnessed aspiration event suggests aspiration pneumonitis rather than aspiration pneumonia.[1]

In most cases, the onset of symptoms in aspiration pneumonia is acute. However, it may present subacutely due to less virulent bacteria. Clinical signs and symptoms commonly observed in patients with aspiration pneumonia include dyspnea, hypoxemia, and fever. One distinguishing feature of aspiration pneumonitis compared to aspiration pneumonia is the occurrence of hyperacute hypoxemia almost immediately in affected patients. This hyperacute hypoxemia can either progress to severe acute lung injury with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome or resolve entirely within 48 hours of onset.[4]

During the initial evaluation, the clinical history should encompass inquiries regarding any episodes of decreased consciousness and swallowing difficulties. Assessing the swallowing efficacy of tablets, solids, and liquids is crucial, especially in older adults. Specific inquiries regarding prior occurrences of pneumonia and periodontal disease should be made. Additionally, obtaining a social history, including details about smoking and alcohol consumption, is imperative for identifying underlying risk factors for aspiration pneumonia.[1]

During the physical examination, cognitive assessment should be conducted in older adults, mainly if there is no history of overt aspiration. Additionally, immediate evaluation for hypoxemia is essential to ensure prompt correction.[1]

## Evaluation

The diagnostic workup recommended by the British Thoracic Society for evaluating patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia includes:[1]

  * Plain chest radiograph (CXR) 

  * Computed tomography (CT) of the chest if CXR is inconclusive or if a CT is required to rule out other diagnoses (such as pulmonary embolism)

  * Microbiological evaluation of sputum and blood

  * Serum electrolytes, albumin, liver enzymes, and complete blood count 
    * These tests are not diagnostic on their own but are recommended to aid in assessing the severity of the systemic response.

    * Additionally, some tests, such as albumin levels, can help evaluate nutritional status and predict prognosis. 

A definitive diagnosis of aspiration requires a videofluoroscopy swallowing study (VFSS), also known as a modified barium swallowing study. Aspiration is confirmed if barium is visible beneath the true vocal cords, a phenomenon termed "silent aspiration" if it occurs without throat clearing or coughing. It's important to recognize that aspiration, particularly microaspiration, is an episodic event that cannot be reliably excluded through a single VFSS study.[1]

Other diagnostic studies used to detect aspiration include:[1]

  * Fiber optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES): This study directly visualizes varying consistencies of food boluses during a swallow. 

  * Scintigraphy: They are primarily used in research settings, not a useful clinical test at this time.

  * Dual-axis accelerometry: Available in specialist centers only 

**Radiologic Studies**

The diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia typically requires radiological evidence of alveolar infiltrates. The presence of infiltrates in dependent areas highly indicates aspiration pneumonia, especially in older adults. However, the specific location of the dependent regions can vary depending on an individual's mobility status. For instance, in mostly upright patients, infiltrates in the basal segments of the lower lobes and the right middle lobe suggest aspiration pneumonia (see **Image.** Aspiration Pneumonia). Conversely, in predominantly bedridden patients, infiltrates may appear in the superior segments of the lower lobes or posterior parts of the upper lobes (see **Image.** Ventilator-Associated Aspiration Pneumonia).

In most cases of aspiration pneumonia, the right lung is more frequently affected than the left.[1] However, the presence of a left-sided infiltrate does not exclude aspiration pneumonia. Bilateral lower lobe involvement may be seen in patients who aspirate while upright, while left-sided infiltrates can occur in those who aspirate while in the left lateral decubitus position. Additionally, patients who aspirate while prone may present with right upper lobe infiltrates.[4]

In patients with fluoroscopically documented dysphagia, bronchopneumonia is more commonly observed than lobar pneumonia. Additionally, most (92%) of these patients develop posterior infiltrates. Furthermore, patients with poor performance typically exhibit diffuse rather than focal infiltrates.[6]

Although a plain radiograph of the chest suffices to acquire this information, it may fail to detect an infiltrate in up to 25% of the cases that are subsequently found to have an infiltrate on CT.[1] In a study involving 208 patients with pneumonia, over 60% had aspiration, and the chest radiograph yielded negative results in 28% of them. However, they were subsequently diagnosed with pneumonia upon CT examination.[6]

Ultrasonography also demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for pneumonia detection. In cases where the CXR is negative, some diagnostic algorithms recommend performing a lung ultrasound before CT to identify the presence of aspiration pneumonia.[3]

**Laboratory Testing** Laboratory evaluation typically reveals acute inflammation and infection signs, such as an elevated white blood cell count (WBC). However, this may not occur in frail older patients as they may be unable to mount an effective response to infection.[1] Currently, no specific biomarker distinguishes aspiration pneumonia from other diseases or even pneumonitis.

Some experts suggest using serum procalcitonin levels to differentiate aspiration pneumonia from aspiration pneumonitis. Procalcitonin is a biomarker specific for bacterial infections, and an elevation is expected in the case of aspiration pneumonia.[4] However, its performance in critically ill patients to differentiate between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis has been poor.[1]

Alpha-amylase levels in airway secretions have been investigated as potential biochemical markers for aspiration. In a study involving mechanically ventilated patients, elevated alpha-amylase levels were observed in airway secretions; however, their precise relevance to aspiration pneumonia and chemical pneumonitis remains uncertain.[6]

**Diagnostic Algorithm**

A recent diagnostic algorithm has been proposed to facilitate the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia and aid in distinguishing it from aspiration pneumonitis. According to the authors of this algorithm, a combination of clinical pneumonia features and characteristic bronchopulmonary findings on radiological assessment is necessary to diagnose aspiration pneumonia.

In frail, older patients presenting with acute respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, along with characteristic radiologic findings, inquiries about the history of known aspiration events should be initiated. Suppose a history of aspiration, along with at least 1 risk factor for oral colonization with a pathogenic or high burden of bacteria, is present. In that case, a definitive diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia can be established.[3]

Risk factors for oral colonization include old age, malnutrition, smoking, dry mouth, poor oral hygiene, and antimicrobial use in the preceding 90 days. Additionally, tracheal cannulation, medications that modify gastric pH (eg, proton pump inhibitors, histamine H2 blockers), enteral nutrition, and inhaled corticosteroids are considered risk factors for oral colonization.[3]

Patients presenting with clinical and radiological findings suggestive of aspiration pneumonia in the absence of a known history of aspiration before a presentation should be diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia if they possess 1 or more risk factors for oral colonization. Risk factors that elevate the likelihood of aspiration include frailty, prior history of stroke, GI disorders, altered mental status, neurologic disorders, or obstructive sleep apnea. Additionally, enteral nutrition, endotracheal intubation, upper GI endoscopy, and recent cardiac arrest are considered risk factors for aspiration.[3]

Patients presenting with clinical and radiologic findings suggestive of aspiration pneumonia without a known history of aspiration before presentation and with at least 1 risk factor for aspiration but without any risk factor for oral colonization should be diagnosed with aspiration pneumonitis.[3]

According to this algorithm, the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis is low in cases where typical clinical symptoms and radiologic findings are present without a history of aspiration, aspiration risk factors, or oral colonization risk factors.[3]

## Treatment / Management

Clinicians should be aware that the recommendations for managing aspiration pneumonia have evolved. Anaerobic coverage is no longer advised in the empiric treatment of aspiration pneumonia due to the low frequency of actual anaerobic infections causing aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, routine diagnostic techniques often cannot reliably detect anaerobic bacteria, which may lead to inappropriate treatment.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) also notes that routine diagnostic techniques cannot reliably detect anaerobic bacteria. Given the lack of microbial culture guidance, inappropriate treatment will likely occur. Therefore the ISDA suggests anaerobic coverage solely in cases of "classic aspiration pleuropulmonary syndromes" where patients have a history of loss of consciousness (eg, alcohol use, drug overdose, seizures) along with concomitant gingival disease or esophageal motility disorders.

Current guidelines recommend empiric treatment for CAP and maintaining high oxygen tension with mechanical ventilation in situations involving small-volume aspirations, such as during intubation.[7] This approach aims to provide appropriate treatment while minimizing the risk of unnecessary antibiotic use.

Current guidelines for treating aspiration pneumonia follow recommendations outlined in 2019 by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and IDSA for managing CAP. The initial step in determining a treatment regimen is to assess the severity of the pneumonia. As per 2019 ATS/IDSA, severe CAP is diagnosed when 1 major criterion or 3 or minor criteria from the following list are present:[8]

  * Minor criteria 
    * Respiratory rate is >30 breaths/min.

    * Ratio of PaO2/FIO2 <250

    * Multilobar infiltrates are present

    * The patient is confused or disoriented

    * Serum urea nitrogen level is >20 mg/dL

    * WBC <4,000 cells/mL due to the severity of the infection (not due to other causes such as malignancy or chemotherapy)

    * Platelet count <100,000/mL

    * Core temperature <36 °C

    * The patient is hypotensive and requires aggressive fluid resuscitation

  * Major criteria 
    * Patient is in septic shock, requiring vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial blood pressure

    * Patient is in respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation

Ampicillin/sulbactam, carbapenems, or respiratory fluoroquinolones (such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) are effective for most patients with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia.[6] According to the 2019 ATS/IDSA guidelines, for adults without severe pneumonia, significant comorbidities, or risk factors for antibiotic-resistant pathogens in the outpatient setting, any 1 of the following regimens is appropriate:[8]

  * Amoxicillin 1 g 3 times daily

  * Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily

  * A macrolide, such as azithromycin 500 mg on the first day, followed by 250 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, or clarithromycin extended-release 1,000 mg daily) 
    * Macrolides should only be used in areas where regional pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is <25%.

Patients with comorbidities such as chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease, renal failure, diabetes, chronic lung disease, alcoholism, asplenia, or malignancy with nonsevere pneumonia who are being treated on an outpatient basis the following treatment options are recommended:[8]

  * Amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg/125 mg 3 times daily, 875 mg/125 mg twice daily, or 2,000 mg/125 mg twice daily

  * A cephalosporin such as cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily or cefuroxime 500 mg twice daily, combined with a macrolide (as described previously) or doxycycline 
    * A cephalosporin and macrolide combination is preferred.

  * A respiratory fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin 750 mg daily, moxifloxacin 400 mg daily, or gemifloxacin 320 mg daily

Hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP, without risk factors for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) infection or  _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ , may be treated with 1 of the following regimens:[8]

  * Ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5 to 3 g every 6 hours or cefotaxime 1 to 2 g every 8 hours or ceftriaxone 1 to 2 g daily or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours plus a macrolide (azithromycin 500 mg daily or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily)

  * Ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5 to 3 g every 6 hours or cefotaxime 1 to 2 g every 8 hours or ceftriaxone 1 to 2 g daily or ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours plus doxycycline 100 mg twice daily 
    * This option is considered third-line therapy in patients with contraindications to fluoroquinolones and macrolides.

  * Levofloxacin 750 mg daily

  * Moxifloxacin 400 mg daily

The only difference in the management of inpatient adults with severe CAP without risk factors for MRSA or _P aeruginosa,_ compared to hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP without these risk factors, is that the former cannot be treated with fluoroquinolone monotherapy or beta-lactam plus doxycycline combination therapy. These regimens have not been studied extensively in this population and are therefore not recommended as empiric therapy for adults with severe CAP.[8]

Patients recently hospitalized (within the last 90 days for at least 5 days), received parenteral antibiotics, and validated risk factors for MRSA or _P aeruginosa,_ should receive empiric coverage for these organisms only if they have severe CAP on presentation. Nonsevere pneumonia in these patients may be treated with the above regimens, with specific testing to rule out these infections.

However, if patients with CAP have previously been infected or colonized with either of these organisms, they should receive empiric coverage regardless of the severity of the pneumonia. MRSA and _P aeruginosa_ coverage may be subsequently discontinued if culture or nasal testing does not isolate these organisms.[8] In patients with validated risk factors for MRSA or _P aeruginosa_ or a prior history of infections secondary to these organisms, treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem, or meropenem is required, in combination with vancomycin or linezolid.[6]

A minimum of 5 days of therapy is required for the treatment.[6][8] Longer durations may be considered for patients with slow clinical response, necrotizing pneumonia, lung abscess, or empyema.[6]

Dedicated anaerobic coverage is not advised in patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. While patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia and accompanying lung abscesses or empyema may be considered for anaerobic coverage, it is essential to note that there is very low-quality evidence supporting this recommendation.[8]

Of particular concern is the use of clindamycin to cover for anaerobes, as it increases the risk for _Clostridium difficile_ colitis. Clinical data shows no significant difference between ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin, and carbapenems for treating suspected aspiration pneumonia. Additionally, moxifloxacin has demonstrated similar efficacy in treating aspiration pneumonia compared to ampicillin/sulbactam, with a clinical response rate of 66.7%.[6]

Clindamycin is recommended only as additional therapy to provide better anaerobic coverage in patients with a high risk of predominantly anaerobic infection, such as those with severe periodontal disease coupled with necrotizing pneumonia or lung abscesses.[6] However, its use should be carefully considered due to the associated risk of  _C_ _difficile_ colitis.

Therapy with glucocorticoids has been extensively studied in patients with aspiration syndromes, but their use has not shown consistent clinical benefit in patients with aspiration-associated pleuropulmonary disease. According to current recommendations, glucocorticoid therapy does not manage aspiration pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.[6][8]

The British Thoracic Society offers similar recommendations for managing aspiration pneumonia, emphasizing the polymicrobial nature of aspiration pneumonia and the necessity for broader-spectrum antibiotics for effective treatment. However, citing ecological concerns associated with the use of cephalosporins, the British Thoracic Society guidelines suggest initiating therapy with amoxicillin for most patients with aspiration pneumonia. In cases of penicillin allergy, alternatives such as respiratory fluoroquinolone, a macrolide, or a tetracycline may be considered.[1]

Adequate oxygenation is another essential component of treatment in patients with treatment in patients with aspiration pneumonia. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend maintaining a 94% to 98% target oxygen saturation for most patients. In acutely ill patients with a higher disease severity, oxygen saturation of 94% to 96% may be optimal. However, exceptions should be made for patients at risk for hypercapnia due to underlying comorbidities, with a target oxygenation range between 88% and 92% as clinically appropriate.[1]
