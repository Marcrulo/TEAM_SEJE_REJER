## Continuing Education Activity

Aspiration pneumonia is a pulmonary infection resulting from the inhalation of bacterial-rich fluids, such as oropharyngeal secretions, particulate matter, or gastric content, into the lower respiratory tract. It predominantly affects older adults, particularly those with advanced age, poor mobility, frailty, and underlying comorbidities, posing significant risks for morbidity and mortality. Individuals with learning disabilities or gastrointestinal and neurologic disorders that disrupt normal swallowing function are also at heightened risk. Both community-acquired and healthcare-associated cases can occur, highlighting the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion among clinicians and healthcare institutions for accurate diagnosis and prevention of aspiration pneumonia-related complications.

This activity comprehensively reviews the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentations, and evidence-based management strategies for adult patients with aspiration pneumonia. By focusing on preventive measures and the utilization of multilevel interprofessional teams within healthcare facilities, this activity equips clinicians with the necessary tools to effectively reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia and optimize patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**

  * Identify the clinical factors that increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia in adult patients. 

  * Develop a diagnostic algorithm for identifying aspiration pneumonia in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia. 

  * Implement current guidelines in selecting antimicrobial therapy for adult patients with aspiration pneumonia. 

  * Collaborate with an interprofessional team of clinicians to implement strategies to minimize the risks associated with aspiration pneumonia.

## Introduction

Aspiration pneumonia is an infectious pulmonary condition triggered by entering bacteria-rich oropharyngeal fluids into the lower respiratory tract. The aspirated fluid may contain oropharyngeal secretions, particulate matter, or gastric content. Aspiration pneumonia manifests across various clinical contexts and primarily affects older adults. It poses significant risks of morbidity and mortality among individuals with learning disabilities and those with gastrointestinal (GI) or neurologic disorders, predisposing them to abnormal swallowing.[1]

Aspiration pneumonia encompasses both community-acquired and healthcare-associated forms, constituting a physiopathological occurrence that lacks a precise definition. According to a recent review following clinical practice guidelines from Japan, aspiration pneumonia diagnosis hinges on the presence of lung inflammation in patients exhibiting evident aspiration, with documented dysphagia, or a clinical condition strongly associated with aspiration or dysphagia.[2] An infectious process, aspiration pneumonia entails the proliferation and invasion of pathogenic bacteria from the inhaled fluid into the pulmonary parenchyma.[3]

Aspiration pneumonitis differs from aspiration pneumonia in clinical presentation. While both occur following an aspiration event, aspiration pneumonitis manifests as a noninfectious chemical lung injury from inhaling sterile fluid or gastric contents.[3]

Clinicians and healthcare institutions must maintain a high suspicion of aspiration pneumonia in patients susceptible to this condition to ensure accurate diagnosis and mitigate complications. However, the existing literature lacks comprehensive guidance in this regard. Moreover, definitively diagnosing aspiration pneumonia, particularly in cases involving multiple microaspirations, poses a significant challenge. Empiric therapy for patients with aspiration pneumonia has also changed, underscoring the necessity for educating clinical providers on typical presentations, diagnostic protocols, and treatment options for aspiration pneumonia.

## Etiology

Natural physiologic defense mechanisms such as the glottis closure and the cough reflex usually prevent aspiration pneumonia. Nevertheless, their failure increases the risk of aspiration and aspiration pneumonia. Various factors contribute to this risk, including altered mental status, neurological disorders, esophageal motility issues, persistent vomiting, and gastric outlet obstruction. Conditions that increase the risk of aspiration in adults include the following:[1][2][3]

  * Advanced age

  * Cerebrovascular disease, known as post-stroke pneumonia

  * Drug overdose

  * Alcohol use disorder

  * Seizures

  * Sedative medication use 

  * Central nervous system disorders 
    * Head trauma

    * Intracranial masses

    * Dementia

    * Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

    * Multiple sclerosis

    * Parkinson disease

    * Pseudobulbar palsy

  * Poor mobility and debility (eg, bedridden status)

  * Esophageal strictures, motility disorders, and cancers

  * Gastroesophageal reflux disease

  * Tracheostomy

  * Nasogastric tube placement

  * Muscular diseases 
    * Inflammatory myopathies

    * Bulbospinal muscular atrophy

    * Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy

Advanced age correlates strongly with aspiration pneumonia, as many older adults experience silent microaspirations that may not be clinically apparent.[1] Among patients aged 70 or older hospitalized with pneumonia, dysphagia prevalence was reported at 91.7%, with silent aspirations occurring in over 50% of cases. However, advanced age does not directly predict the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Frailty, poor nutritional status, and limited mobility are considered more reliable indicators of aspiration risk in older patients.[3]

According to various estimates, the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia in specific patient populations is as follows:

  * Acute stroke patients: between 3% and 50% [1]

  * Post-cerebrovascular event silent aspiration: Occurs in 40% to 70% of cases [3]

  * Hospitalized patients with Parkinson disease or dementia: up to 11% over 3 months [1]

  * Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication of multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, Huntington disease, Down syndrome, and cerebral palsy.[1]

  * Head and neck cancer and its treatment increase the aspiration pneumonia risk, with up to 70% of patients developing aspiration pneumonia during their lifetime. This risk in survivors further increases with time.[1]

In addition to the above predisposing factors, a crucial risk factor for aspiration pneumonia is the degree of bacterial colonization in oral secretions. Even minimal aspiration can lead to infection if there's a high density of bacterial colonization in oropharyngeal secretions, providing ample "bacterial load" for inoculation. A population-based case-control study of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) noted poor oral health as a risk factor for infection. Similarly, poor oral health has been established as a significant risk factor for aspiration pneumonia among hospitalized patients.[3]

## Epidemiology

The variability among patients with aspiration and inconsistent diagnostic practices pose challenges in determining the true incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Data suggests that up to 20% of individuals in the US experience some degree of impaired swallowing, contributing to approximately 0.4% of all hospital admissions being attributed to aspiration pneumonia.[1] The incidence of aspiration pneumonia among patients with CAP ranges between 5% and 15.5% in the US, United Kingdom, and Korea. However, studies from Japan report a notably higher incidence, around 60%, among patients presenting with CAP. Moreover, aspiration pneumonia among patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in Japan is approximately.[2]

In patients under 80, an aspiration event leads to pneumonia only 5% of the time, whereas patients older than 80 develop pneumonia 10% of the time following such an event. Notably, among nursing home residents diagnosed with pneumonia, 18% to 30% of cases are associated with an aspiration event.[3]

It is imperative to recognize that not all aspiration events result in pneumonia. For instance, in cases involving anesthesia, up to 64% of instances did not exhibit any clinical or radiological signs of infection following aspiration events.[4]
