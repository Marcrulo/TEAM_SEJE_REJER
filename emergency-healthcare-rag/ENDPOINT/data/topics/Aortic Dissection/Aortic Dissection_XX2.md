## History and Physical

Acute aortic dissection presents with a range of symptoms that reflect the extent of the dissection and the specific cardiovascular structures involved. The patient’s history plays a crucial role in recognizing the dissection, and 3 key elements should be emphasized: the quality, radiation, and intensity of pain at the onset. Study results have identified pain intensity at onset as one of the most reliable historical factors in diagnosing acute aortic dissection. The classic presentation is a sudden, severe, tearing pain that often reaches maximum intensity within minutes. The location of the pain may vary, typically appearing in the anterior chest for dissections involving the ascending aorta and in the back for those involving the descending aorta. Additionally, the pain may migrate as the dissection extends distally. In about 10% of cases, especially in individuals with Marfan syndrome, patients may not report pain, complicating the clinical picture.

While the hallmark presentation of acute aortic dissection includes severe chest or back pain, it can be accompanied by neurological symptoms or limb ischemia, depending on the vessels involved. The presence of chest pain with neurological deficits (such as stroke-like symptoms, limb weakness, or paresthesia), the combination of chest and abdominal pain, or chest pain with syncope should all prompt suspicion of acute aortic dissection.[18] Neurological deficits are seen in approximately 20% of patients, and syncope is relatively common, which can be due to various mechanisms, including hypovolemia, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction. If the dissection propagates into peripheral vessels, symptoms like loss of pulses, pain, and paresthesias in the extremities may occur. Physical findings are diverse and may provide critical diagnostic clues. Still, classical signs like blood pressure discrepancies between the upper extremities, pulse deficits, or a diastolic murmur are found in less than 50% of confirmed acute aortic dissection cases. These signs should raise clinical suspicion, especially if combined with typical pain and neurological symptoms. Blood pressure discrepancies greater than 20 mm Hg between arms, a pulse deficit, or wide pulse pressure are red flags in the physical exam.

Hypertension is common in acute aortic dissection, but hypotension is a grave sign, often indicating aortic rupture or cardiac tamponade. Patients may present with muffled heart sounds, syncope, and shock in such cases. A new diastolic murmur suggests aortic insufficiency, often associated with proximal dissections. If the dissection involves the carotid or subclavian arteries, signs of Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis) or hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement may appear. Additionally, dyspnea and hemoptysis may result from dissection rupture into the mediastinum. Notably, if a patient presents with abdominal pain, renal or biliary colic, or bowel obstruction/perforation, nondissection-related mesenteric ischemia should be considered. Pulse deficit can be a sign of nondissection-related embolic phenomena or arterial occlusion.[19] In summary, the clinical presentation of acute aortic dissection varies widely. While the classic signs and symptoms are invaluable for diagnosis, the absence of these features does not rule out the condition. A combination of a detailed pain history, neurological findings, and physical examination features such as blood pressure discrepancies, pulse deficits, or murmurs should alert clinicians to the possibility of a dissection and prompt immediate diagnostic evaluation.

## Evaluation

The evaluation and workup of acute aortic dissection are centered on rapid identification and confirmation of the condition, given its high mortality if left untreated. The diagnostic approach is guided by clinical suspicion, the patient’s hemodynamic stability, and the availability of imaging modalities. An integrated approach combining clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and advanced imaging modalities is essential to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate management.

**Clinical Evaluation**

As previously discussed, the initial assessment begins with a focused history and physical examination. Once a patient with a possible aortic dissection is identified, further workup begins. 

**Electrocardiogram**

Although an electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely performed to evaluate chest pain, its findings are often nonspecific in an acute aortic dissection. ST-segment changes may suggest myocardial ischemia, particularly if the dissection extends to involve the coronary arteries. The presence of ECG findings consistent with an acute myocardial infarction occurs in 8% of cases of acute aortic dissection. However, a normal ECG does not exclude a dissection, and a high index of clinical suspicion should be maintained based on presenting symptoms and history.

**Chest Radiography**

A chest x-ray may reveal a widened mediastinum (>8 cm), abnormal aortic contour, pleural effusion, or loss of the aortic knob, suggesting aortic dissection. However, up to 20% of patients may have a normal chest x-ray, so the absence of findings does not rule out the diagnosis. Additional suggestive findings include:

  * Left apical cap

  * Pleural effusion

  * Deviation of the esophagus or trachea

  * Depression of the left mainstem bronchus

  * Loss of the paratracheal stripe

**Laboratory Evaluation**

Laboratory tests are useful adjuncts but are not diagnostic for acute aortic dissection. They help assess the clinical status and organ function. Important laboratory tests include:

  * D-dimer: Elevated D-dimer levels (>500 ng/mL) are highly sensitive to acute aortic dissection due to increased fibrinolytic activity from forming a false lumen. However, D-dimer lacks specificity and should not be used as a standalone test, but it may help rule out the condition in low-risk patients.

  * Cardiac biomarkers, including troponin: Mildly elevated troponin levels may be seen, especially if there is coronary artery involvement or myocardial infarction.

  * Complete blood count: Leukocytosis is common but nonspecific. A drop in hematocrit may suggest intraluminal blood loss.

  * Renal function tests: Elevated creatinine levels can indicate renal ischemia from dissection involving the renal arteries.

  * Serum lactate levels: Elevated lactate levels may indicate poor perfusion or tissue ischemia due to branch vessel involvement.

  * Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain assay: An elevated smooth muscle myosin heavy chain SM-MHC assay is specific for acute aortic dissection. The SM-MHC assay is a rapid 30-minute test that can detect circulating SM-MHC protein. However, smooth muscle proteins can only detect the dissection after it occurs, and they are not useful for predicting or monitoring chronic aortic dissections.

**Imaging Modalities**

Definitive diagnosis of aortic dissection relies on advanced imaging to identify the intimal tear, evaluate the extent of dissection, and assess complications. The choice of imaging modality is determined by the patient’s stability, clinical scenario, and institutional availability:

  * Computed tomography angiography 
    * Computed tomography (CTA) is the first-line imaging modality in most cases due to its high sensitivity and specificity, widespread availability, and rapid acquisition.[20] This modality provides detailed images of the aorta, showing the intimal flap, true and false lumens, aortic dilation, hematoma, and complications such as contrast leak (indicating rupture) and branch vessel involvement. CTA is particularly useful in differentiating type A and type B dissections.

  * Transesophageal echocardiography 
    * Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is often the imaging modality of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients or when CTA is not available. TEE provides high-resolution, real-time images of the aortic root, ascending aorta, and descending thoracic aorta, enabling accurate detection of proximal dissections (type A) and complications like aortic regurgitation or cardiac tamponade. TEE is also valuable during intraoperative evaluations, guiding surgical or endovascular procedures, and assessing blood flow in the true and false lumens before and immediately after aortic interventions.[7] Findings may include: 
      * Dissection flap with differential Doppler flow

      * True and false lumen in the ascending aorta

      * Thrombosis in the false lumen

      * Central displacement of intimal calcification

      * Pericardial effusion

  * Magnetic resonance imaging 
    * Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly accurate but less commonly used in acute settings due to limited availability and longer acquisition times. This modality is particularly useful for follow-up in chronic dissections and patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast. MRI offers excellent visualization of branch vessel involvement and soft tissue contrast, making it preferred in selected cases.

  * Transthoracic echocardiography 
    * Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is less reliable for diagnosing aortic dissections due to poor visualization of the distal aorta but is beneficial for evaluating patients with acute aortic syndromes and assessing complications such as aortic regurgitation, left ventricular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion (suggesting tamponade).[7] TTE can be used as an initial bedside tool in unstable patients.

  * Aortography 
    * Once the gold standard for evaluating aortic dissections, aortography is now rarely used for initial diagnosis but may still be employed when planning endovascular stent placement.

**Risk Stratification Tools**

Clinical decision-making tools such as the Aortic Dissection Detection Risk Score (ADD-RS) can help identify high-risk AAD patients. This scoring system incorporates factors from history, physical examination, and imaging to guide the need for further testing. A high-risk ADD-RS score, combined with elevated D-dimer, increases the likelihood of AAD and may justify immediate imaging. Prompt recognition and diagnosis of AAD are crucial to prevent catastrophic complications, including aortic rupture, cardiac tamponade, or ischemic injury to vital organs. Timely imaging, particularly CTA, remains central to confirming the diagnosis and guiding management decisions.

## Treatment / Management

Management of aortic dissection begins with immediate stabilization and consultation with a cardiothoracic or vascular surgeon, regardless of the location of the dissection. Due to the high mortality associated with untreated AAD, the approach to management involves a combination of urgent surgical intervention and medical therapy to reduce hemodynamic stress on the aorta.

**Initial Stabilization and Medical Management**

Once the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection is confirmed or highly suspected, a multidisciplinary team should be activated promptly. Initial management includes:

  * **Monitoring and access**
    * Continuous monitoring with an arterial line for real-time blood pressure measurements

    * Placement of a central venous catheter for hemodynamic monitoring and administration of medications

    * Foley catheter insertion to monitor urine output, as oliguria or anuria may indicate renal hypoperfusion

  * **Medical therapy**
    * Analgesia 
      * Pain control is crucial. Morphine is the preferred analgesic as it controls pain and decreases sympathetic tone, which helps reduce blood pressure and heart rate.

    * Heart rate and blood pressure control 
      * Short-acting intravenous beta blockers (eg, esmolol or labetalol) are the first-line agents. The goal is to maintain a heart rate of approximately 60 beats per minute to reduce the force of left ventricular ejection against the aortic wall. 
        * Beta blockers should be used with caution in the setting of acute aortic regurgitation, where compensatory tachycardia may be beneficial for maintaining cardiac output.

      * If beta blockers are contraindicated (eg, in patients with severe asthma or bronchospastic disease), nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like diltiazem can be used as alternatives.

    * Blood pressure target 
      * Systolic blood pressure should be lowered between 100 and 120 mm Hg, provided end-organ perfusion is not compromised. If additional blood pressure control is needed, nitroprusside can be added to the beta-blocker regimen. Other vasodilators, like nicardipine, may also be used.

    * Management of hypotension 
      * In hypotensive patients, intravenous fluid resuscitation is the first approach. However, excessive fluid can exacerbate aortic wall stress, so caution is warranted. If hypotension persists, vasopressors (eg, norepinephrine) can be administered to maintain perfusion, but these agents should be used carefully as they can increase the force of ventricular contraction and potentially worsen the dissection.

**Definitive Treatment Based on AAD Classification**

The type and location of the dissection—classified by the Stanford or DeBakey systems—determine the need for surgical or medical intervention.

  * **Stanford type A dissections (involving the ascending aorta)**
    * Urgent surgical intervention 
      * Type A dissections are considered surgical emergencies due to the risk of catastrophic complications such as cardiac tamponade, severe aortic regurgitation, myocardial infarction, or aortic rupture. Surgical mortality varies from 5% to 20%. Surgical intervention involves: 
        * Excision of the intimal tear 
          * Remove the primary tear site and obliterate entry points into the false lumen to prevent further propagation.

        * Aortic replacement 
          * Placement of a synthetic graft to reconstitute the aortic architecture

        * Aortic valve assessment and repair/replacement 
          * If the dissection extends into the aortic root or involves the aortic valve, valve repair or replacement with a prosthetic valve may be necessary. The decision to perform a Bentall procedure (combined aortic root and valve replacement) is based on the extent of root involvement.

    * Management of aortic arch involvement 
      * AADs that extend into the aortic arch are among the most complex to manage surgically, given the need for cerebral protection and the higher risk of neurologic complications, including paraplegia.

  * **Stanford type B dissections (involving the descending aorta)**
    * Medical management 
      * Uncomplicated type B dissections are typically managed with aggressive blood pressure and heart rate control. The goal is to reduce aortic wall stress, prevent progression, and monitor for complications.

    * Indications for intervention 
      * Endovascular or surgical intervention is indicated for: 
        * Malperfusion syndromes 
          * Dissections causing ischemia to organs such as the kidneys, intestines, or limbs require urgent intervention.

        * Aortic rupture or impending rupture 
          * Rapid expansion, recurrent pain, or signs of contained rupture mandate immediate repair.

    * Interventions 
      * Endovascular stent-grafting 
        * Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is preferred for complicated type B dissections.[2][21][22] TEVAR involves placing a stent-graft to seal the dissection entry tear and exclude the false lumen, promoting healing and remodeling of the aorta. TEVAR is associated with significantly lower morbidity and mortality compared to open surgical repair. However, patient selection is key, as factors like anatomy, dissection extent, and complications influence outcomes.

      * Surgical repair 
        * Open surgery for type B dissections is reserved for cases where TEVAR is not feasible or for patients with severe complications. Open repair is associated with a higher risk of paraplegia due to potential spinal cord ischemia.
